In our Quality Engineering organization, we create, configure, and destroy a lot
of servers via automation. [Ansible](https://ansible.com) is a great method for
handling the configuration of servers, but the creation of Ansible roles and
playbooks can be trial and error for even experienced Operations Engineers.
[Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a way to speed
up the development and confidence of Ansible roles and playbooks by wrapping a
virtualization driver with tools for testing and linting.

<!--more-->

## Installation

Molecule and Ansible can be installed by using `pip`, but I would recommend not
running this in a dedicated virtual environment. I typically run on a Fedora
system and have run into issues with `libselinux` when using a virtual environment.
A quick online search can provide a work around or two, but I find it easiest to
use the `--user` flag to install Molecule with the user scheme.

```
pip install --upgrade --user ansible
pip install --upgrade --user molecule
```

If you don't already have `ansible` or `molecule` installed, running a pip
install results in some significant output. Pip is good about drawing attention
to errors, even if the resolution isn't always clear, but the last couple lines
of output provide the libraries and versions installed from those commands.

## Getting started

If you're creating a new role in an existing Ansible playbook directory, simply
access the `roles` directory in it. If you're just following along to learn
Molecule, create an empty directory to hold your new Ansible playbooks.

```
~/$ mkdir -p ~/Projects/example_playbooks/roles
~/$ cd ~/Projects/example_playbooks/roles
```

In the interest of brevity, I'm not including the pip installation output. But,
the output below provides the software versions used in the creation of this
example. Both Ansible and Molecule development move quick and do have some
significant changes between point releases, so if the version numbers vary
significantly, these instructions might now work verbatim.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks$ ansible --version
ansible 2.6.4
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/dan/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/dan/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /home/dan/.local/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]
~/Projects/example_playbooks$ molecule --version
molecule, version 2.17.0
~/Projects/example_playbooks$ tree
.

0 directories, 0 files
~/Projects/example_playbooks$
```

## Create a role

Molecule has pretty excellent help output with `molecule --help`. In this example,
we're going to create a role with `molecule` and use the `vagrant` provider.
`molecule` defaults to Docker for provisioning, but I prefer to use `vagrant`
with VirtualBox because the majority of the testing environments I interact with
are virtual machines and not containers.

Creating a role and specifying both the name and driver creates a role directory
structure.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks$ molecule init role --role-name nginx_install --driver-name vagrant
--> Initializing new role nginx_install...
Initialized role in /home/dan/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install successfully.
~/Projects/example_playbooks$ tree
.
└── nginx_install
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── molecule
    │   └── default
    │       ├── INSTALL.rst
    │       ├── molecule.yml
    │       ├── playbook.yml
    │       ├── prepare.yml
    │       └── tests

    ├── README.md
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    └── vars
        └── main.yml

8 directories, 11 files
```

As you can see, that command creates quite a few directories. Most of the
following files and directories are standard and are considered best practises
for Ansible.

* defaults - default values to variables for the role
* handlers - specific handlers to notify based on actions in Ansible
* meta - Ansible-Galaxy info for the role if you are uploading this to Ansible-Galaxy
* molecule - molecule specific information (configuration, instance information,
playbooks to run with molecule, etc)
* README.md - Information about the role. Well documented, excellent feature
(I'm a big fan of documentation, should be obvious if you're reading this)
* tasks - tasks for the role
* vars - other variables for the role

## Modifications from default Molecule

Theres a few defaults I **always** change when using `molecule` because it uses
`Cookie-Cutter` to create a default configuration. The first, `molecule` defaults
to the Ubuntu operating system, but the majority of our test systems are RHEL based. Also I prefer to
specify the memory and CPUs rather than relying on the box defaults.

Another thing we'll change from default is to set up port forwarding. Because
we're using `nginx` in this example, we may as well set it up so we can hit the
webserver locally.

These changes are made by modifying the `molecule/default/molecule.yml` file to
be similar to the following example. This `molecule.yml` file is where `molecule`
looks for the configuration of instances, testing, linting, etc.

*Heads up, a raw copy/pasta of the following code will result in an error. Read on to see why*

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install$ cat molecule/default/molecule.yml
---
dependency:
  name: galaxy
driver:
  name: vagrant
  provider:
    name: virtualbox
lint:
  name: yamllint
platforms:
  - name: nginx_install
    box: centos/7
    instance_raw_config_args:
      - "vm.network 'forwarded_port', guest: 80, host: 9000"
    memory: 512
    cpus: 1
provisioner:
  name: ansible
  lint:
    name: ansible-lint
scenario:
  name: default
verifier:
  name: testinfra
  lint:
    name: flake8
```

Once we've got the `molecule` configuration to our liking, time to start working
on the role itself. Ansible role tasks are in `tasks/main.yml` for the role. This
example is pretty simple, so all we're doing is installing a repository to install
`nginx`, installing `nginx`, and starting/enabling `nginx`. The only Ansible
modules we need for this is `yum` for package installation and `systemd` to start
and enable the service.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install$ cat tasks/main.yml
---
# tasks file for nginx_install
- name: Install epel-release for nginx
  yum:
    name: epel-release
    state: present
  become: "yes"

- name: install nginx
  yum:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  become: "yes"

- name: ensure nginx running and enabled
  systemd:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: "yes"
  become: "yes"
```

Molecule does some great things. It handles the orchestration of the virtual
environment to test, lints Ansible syntax, lints and runs a test suite, and even
destroys the created resources on completion.

## Writing tests for the role

We can manually test the role with some SSHing and curl, but
[testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is included as the
default verifier step of `molecule`. Testinfra uses `pytest` and makes it easy
to test the system after the role is run to ensure our created role has the
results that we expected.

This role is pretty simple, so our tests are pretty simple. Since we're just
installing and starting `nginx`, there's not a whole lot more we're looking for
in our test. Of course `molecule` provides a good demonstration test to build
up a test suite and `testinfra` documentation even uses `nginx` in their
[quickstart](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Tests - quantity or quality?

The following three tests are all pretty simple. The overall count of tests
really doesn't matter as much as the quality of tests. While we've got three
tests in this example, we could easily have one or five. This might vary based
on the Software Developer, but I chose the following three because they follow
a logical order.

1. Make sure nginx is installed
1. Make sure nginx configuration was installed correctly
1. Make sure nginx is running and enabled

This is easiest to understand by looking at it backwards. If we had one test to
see if `nginx` is running, when it fails we won't know why it fails. That one
test can't tell us if it was not installed, if the configuration was incorrect,
or if it was not started. My approach is to first make sure it is installed,
next check if the configuration exists (in a more elaborate example, we'd
instead check to make sure there is some expected text in the configuration file).
Finally, we make sure `nginx` is running and enabled. This way the tests follow
a logical flow of prerequisites to get to our ultimate state, and knock out
some troubleshooting steps along the way.

```
cat molecule/default/tests/test_default.py
import os

import testinfra.utils.ansible_runner

testinfra_hosts = testinfra.utils.ansible_runner.AnsibleRunner(
    os.environ['MOLECULE_INVENTORY_FILE']).get_hosts('all')


def test_nginx_installed(host):
    nginx = host.package('nginx')
    assert nginx.is_installed

def test_nginx_config_exists(host):
    nginx_config = host.file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf')
    assert nginx_config.exists

def test_nginx_running(host):
    nginx_service = host.service('nginx')
    assert nginx_service.is_running
    assert nginx_service.is_enabled
```

## Running Molecule

We've got both our role and tests written. We could just run `molecule test`
and work through all the steps. But, I prefer running `create`, `converge`, and
`test` all separately and in that order. This separates the various steps and
makes any failures easier to track down.

### Molecule create

The first step of Molecule is the creation of the virtual machine. For `Docker`
and `vagrant` providers, Molecule includes a default `create` playbook. Running
`molecule create` creates the virtual machine for our role based on the
`molecule.yml` configuration.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install$ molecule create
--> Validating schema /home/dan/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install/molecule/default/molecule.yml.
Validation completed successfully.
--> Test matrix

└── default
    ├── create
    └── prepare

--> Scenario: 'default'

    PLAY [Create] ******************************************************************

    TASK [Create molecule instance(s)] *********************************************

    localhost                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=1


ERROR:
```

That create gave us an error, and Ansible has a `no_log` property for tasks that
is intended to prevent the outputting secrets that stopped us from seeing what
exactly went wrong. We can set the environment variable of `MOLECULE_DEBUG` to
log errors, but the first thing I do to save some typing is rerun the command
with `--debug` flag.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install$ molecule --debug create
...
        },
        "item": {
            "box": "centos/7",
            "cpus": 1,
            "instance_raw_config_args": [
                "vm.network 'forwarded_port', guest: 80, host: 9000"
            ],
            "memory": 512,
            "name": "nginx_install"
        },
        "msg": "ERROR: See log file '/tmp/molecule/nginx_install/default/vagrant-nginx_install.err'"
    }

    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    localhost                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=1

```

Reading into the error tells us it was an "error" in Vagrant and not necessarily
one with `molecule` itself. We can look at the file provided in the error output
for more clues.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install$ cat /tmp/molecule/nginx_install/default/vagrant-nginx_install.err
### 2018-09-07 17:32:59 ###
### 2018-09-07 17:32:59 ###

the following errors and try again:

vm:
* The hostname set for the VM should only contain letters, numbers,
hyphens or dots. It cannot start with a hyphen or dot.

### 2018-09-07 17:33:20 ###
### 2018-09-07 17:33:20 ###
There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
the following errors and try again:

vm:

hyphens or dots. It cannot start with a hyphen or dot.

```

Well, that's easy. Our hostname can't contain `_`. A quick edit to the
`molecule.yml` should fix this right up.

```
~/Projects/example_playbooks/nginx_install$ grep -A1 platform molecule/default/molecule.yml
platforms:
  - name: nginx-install
```

Now, we try again on the `create`:

```

### Molecule converge

Molecule `create` only acts as orchestration. The `coverge` step is what runs
our playbook that calls our role to configure the environment. There's good
reason to do these steps separate. First, the `create` step ensures our virtual
machine is provisioned and started correctly. After it's up, we've got less
troubleshooting when actually running the playbook.

Another benefit of running steps separately is that, on a more complicated role,
we could just run `converge` after every task to which we add to our role to make
sure that it does what we intend for it to do. Because we only have three simple
tasks, we can run converge to test all tasks at the same time.

```

Cool. It worked, or at least looks like it did. Even though our playbooks ran
without errors, running our tests will validate that it did what we think it did.

### Molecule test

Now we run test. This goes through all the steps and tells us whether what we
think we're doing is actually working based our our `testinfra` tests. This
tests our role by destroying any existing virtual machine, checking the syntax
on the role, creating a new virtual machine, running our playbook, and linting
and running our tests. If there are any issues, this should let us know.

Another unintended failure. Lint issues in the python tests. Flake provides
excellent output for pep errors, so we know exactly what to fix based on the output.

We can address those issues and then rerun the command, which should result in
the following:

```

Great! With all that, now we know that our Ansible and Python tests are linted,
and our tests run. This means our role does what we **intend** for it to do.

### Molecule verify

I did skip a step here. So far I have described the steps for:

* `molecule create` - create the virtual machine to make sure `molecule` is
configured correctly.
* `molecule converge` - run multiple times as we add tasks to our role.
* `molecule test` - once we're happy, run all the steps of Molecule.

Really though, since `molecule test` runs through all the steps (creation,
linting, testing, deletion, etc), and earlier I laid out the steps of running
converge to manually test each time, this does not exactly fit the workflow I
mentioned previously. We can separate out the `molecule` steps a little further.

Rather than running `molecule test`, we can run `molecule verify` separately to
skip the little bit of extra time in creating and destroying the virtual machine.

## Conclusion

Molecule is a great abstraction for the multiple steps of create, test, and
clean that happen during development of an Ansible role. Not only does it create
and provide sane defaults to the directory structure of a role, it makes it easy
to create a test a role during development. While there is a bit of a learning
curve, the increased productivity of testing during development makes it an
absolutely worthwhile investment.
