This post explores why Rackspace chose CloudHealth and how we’ve taken a
customer-focused approach to integrating and setting up CloudHealth.

### Why CloudHealth?

Controlling cloud costs is the most cited pain point for public cloud consumers.
CloudHealth empowers Rackspace to effectively govern your cloud spend in the
following three areas:

– Visibility: Before you can control cloud costs, you have to identify and
understand them&mdash;a tall order for AWS and other cloud providers with
notoriously complex billing. Users across an organization also need different
information. For example, the person in Finance who is choosing among Savings
Plans or Reserved Instances needs different information than the budget owner
in Engineering who wants to see an e-mailed report of trending costs and an
actionable view of underutilized resources.

– Control: Common ways that organizations control costs include creating budgets,
establishing departmental accountability (including chargeback or showback), and
exercising governance methods such as *no tag, no play*.

– Savings: With few exceptions, most organizations significantly overspend in
the public cloud. In addition to helping with visibility and control, CloudHealth
clearly shows how to take advantage of discounts like Reserved Instances and
Savings Plans, identifies unneeded and unused resources, and more.

We believe that CloudHealth enables Rackspace, working with our customers, to
solve for these three outcomes better than any other platform. As a bonus, it
works across AWS, Azure&reg;, and the Google Compute Platform&reg;.

### Our Integration and Approach

Rackspace is the first CloudHealth partner to fully integrate with their
platform to include everything from account setup to user management. For example,
customers can use single sign-on from the Rackspace portal into CloudHealth.
Users have full access to CloudHealth with near real-time cost data, savings
opportunities, inventory, and much more.

We also recognize that access to powerful tools is a necessary first step to
achieving your goals, but it's not enough on its own. Rackspace adds expertise
on top of CloudHealth to help you to set up reporting for different users.
Examples include configuring CloudHealth *Perspectives*, which meaningfully
segment spend and other data, reviewing cost trending and actionable savings
opportunities with you, and setting up governance policies.

### Summary

We are proud to provide Rackers and our Fanatical Support for AWS customers with
CloudHealth to help with complex challenges around visibility, control, and
cloud spend savings. Our ultimate goal is to work closely with you to achieve
meaningful outcomes.
