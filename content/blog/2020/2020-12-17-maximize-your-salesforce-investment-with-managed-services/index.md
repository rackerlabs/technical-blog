### Managed services

{{<img src="Picture1.png" title="" alt="">}}

Rackspace offers a way to manage these ongoing needs through a
[Managed Services](https://www.rackspace.com/applications/salesforce) offering. Our business
process and technology engineering team can provide you with ongoing services and support
to optimize your investment in Salesforce and maximize business results following the
initial implementation.

This service allows you to plan and forecast the time you need to perform various
functions and receive these services at a discounted rate. Some examples of the roles and
functions available with a Managed Services Agreement include:

- Business Process Engineer
- Salesforce Architect
- Salesforce Engineer
- Salesforce Administrator
- Marketing Automation Specialist
- Business Analyst
- Project Manager

### Conclusion

This service works well if you have a roadmap of ongoing projects and services
you plan to provide and a need for ongoing support. It gives the flexibility to use and
pay for only the necessary level of resources at any given time. For less than the cost of
a full-time Salesforce Administrator, you can leverage our experienced team and take full
advantage of everything the Salesforce platform makes possible.
