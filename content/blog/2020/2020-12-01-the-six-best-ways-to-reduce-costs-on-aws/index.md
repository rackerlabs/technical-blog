According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en), without cloud cost optimization,
businesses could be overspending by more than 70% in the cloud. It’s easy for companies to
tie up excess spend in current tooling without realizing it. This post offers six things
you can do to help improve your infrastructure while freeing up spend for other business
initiatives.

### What are the best ways to reduce costs on AWS?

According to our cloud cost optimization experts, you can do the following six things to help improve your 
AWS&reg; infrastructure while freeing up spend for other business initiatives:

#### 1. Use a cost dashboard to track and understand costs

With cost allocation tags, you can create a cost dashboard to get a granular look at costs by region, 
service, and other important factors. This not only lets you track spending but also 
identify the baseline cost.

#### 2. Monitor cost trends

Certain cost trends are indicators of cloud architecture patterns that can lead to cost concerns. 
Knowing what these look like upfront can prevent long-term cost consequences.

#### 3. Look at cost versus utilization

Without automation, you can easily commit errors like horizontal and vertical scaling, which ultimately 
result in using the wrong resources or not having the right resources for the right price. By tracking your 
utilization and turning off old instances, you can find simple ways to save on wasted resources.

#### 4. Examine cost ratios

Cost ratios depend on your environment, but they can be a valuable way to gain insight into the health 
and efficiency of your infrastructure. Ratios show where optimization might be valuable and where a change 
in strategy might be necessary.

#### 5. Use a tagging strategy

Tagging allows you to separate and differentiate costs by a product or service, allowing you to see 
the differences in usage. Managing tags can keep accounts in order and identify services that might need 
optimizing.

#### 6. Have a reserved instances strategy

Reserved instances can be valuable financial instruments to maintaining a low AWS spend. Having a 
reserved instance strategy allows you to cut costs by planning for your architectural needs upfront.

Finding the IT budget to drive new business initiatives can be a challenge. Similarly, knowing the appropriate 
IT spend for your business and how to optimize it is an issue all its own. This
[eBook](https://insights.onica.com/costoptimization2019) helps with some of those pain points. With our
[six steps to optimizing the AWS Cloud](https://docs.rackspace.com/blog/top-six-best-practices-to-optimize-costs-on-aws/),
you’ll learn how to improve your infrastructure and also free up budgets to
drive innovation and move your business forward.

Following our six steps provides immediate impact by offering valuable insight into your current costs and 
give you areas to optimize, as explained by Timothy Fox, former VP of Solutions, managed services at Onica, 
a Rackspace Technology company:  

    _*"We have a customer that had a huge number of unattached EBS
    volumes. When I say huge, we’re talking $20,000 to $30,000 USD per
    month-volumes that nobody is using. That’s where Cloud Optimizer™
    comes in: it helps you identify idle and unused resources."*_

#### Understand your cost

While it should be as simple as glancing at your bill, understanding your AWS cost
is not always easy. A typical AWS detailed billing record (DBR) has
two to eight unique line items for every dollar of cost. If you use cost
allocation tags, the data becomes even more granular.  AWS cost management can
get convoluted quickly with 97 AWS services, 20 regions, and thousands of unique usage types.
Because of this complexity, you should treat cost management on AWS as a data
problem. The primary challenge is to identify actionable cost-trend information
(such as costs for specific services or usage types) within the larger
overall cost trend. The first step toward managing AWS costs is to tackle the
data problem with a data solution.

#### Let’s start with cost dashboards

A good *cost dashboard* lets you track spend down to meaningful sub-components,
which should help you establish baseline cost, as well as understand variation and trends.

Your dashboard should track the following items:

+ Cost by service
+ Cost by region
+ Cost by unique AWS account
+ Cost by allocation
+ Day-to-day cost trends
+ Month-to-month cost trends

By breaking out cost tracking this way, you can understand which
services and assets in play have the greatest impact, identify items that are no
longer in use, and track trends to establish cost expectations for your
environment.
