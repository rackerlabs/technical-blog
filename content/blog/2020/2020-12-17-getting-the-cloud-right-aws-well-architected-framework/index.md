Few people would consider building a home, let alone an enterprise office
complex, without the help of an architect. The architectural plan defines every
aspect of a building from the foundation to the rooftop and is what contractors
use to build a safe, reliable, functional structure.

The same is true for cloud computing environments. It would be foolhardy to
migrate to or build a cloud infrastructure without a sound architectural plan.
That’s why Amazon&reg; developed the Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS)
Well-Architected Framework&reg; (WAF). It’s Amazon’s blueprint for a
strong, secure, scalable cloud infrastructure, guiding you through some of the
decisions you’ll have to make to ensure that your architecture is robust
from top to bottom.

### Reaching your goals

According to [IDG](https://www.idg.com/tools-for-marketers/2016-idg-enterprise-cloud-computing-survey/),
*Lowering total cost of ownership, replacing on-premise legacy technology and
enabling business continuity are the top business goals driving cloud investments.*
Computerworld’s Tech Forecast found that some 90 percent of enterprises are using
the cloud to improve business outcomes. This makes sense&mdash;the reasons for
moving infrastructure to the cloud are more business-driven than IT driven. It’s
all about lowering operating costs while making your business more nimble.

Usually, flexibility costs money. Not with the cloud. For example, government
IT leaders report reducing costs 20-50 percent by migrating operations to
AWS’s GovCloud&reg; with the added benefits of improved security, compliance, and
performance. But as Dan Woods of
[CITO Research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2016/02/23/avoiding-the-3-most-common-cloud-design-mistakes/#5f9faa2f6867)
writes: Let’s face it: "the cloud is cool, but learning about the cloud is not
the point. You can become a master of the cloud and still not understand how to use it to improve your business.”

“To avoid this mistake,” Woods says, “spend at least as much time understanding
the computing workloads that support your business as you do working to understand the cloud.”

### A framework for success

Hence Amazon’s Well-Architected Framework. It’s a tool to help businesses create
a sound cloud strategy by comparing your workload against Amazon’s best practices
and obtain guidance to produce stable and efficient systems so you can
focus on functional requirements.

The AWS WAF is built around five pillars that form the bedrock for
building an AWS infrastructure:

- **Security**: Security is the first pillar, as this is widely seen as a barrier to
  cloud adoption. Though Capital One CEO Rob Alexander famously said that
  AWS “enables us to operate more securely in the public cloud than we can
  even in our own private data centers.” Security involves more than just
  data protection. Topics covered include confidentiality, access control,
  system-level threat protection, and establishing controls to detect security events.

- **Reliability**: Ensuring availability at peak traffic times, the ability to
  recover from failures and overall business continuity are all part of this
  pillar. Key topics include laying the right foundation at setup,
  cross-project requirements, recovery planning, and change management.

- **Performance efficiency**: AWS offers a dizzying array of products and
  options, many of which reward careful planning with significant financial
  savings. It’s critical to balance near-term and long-term requirements to
  select the right resource types and sizes.

- **Cost optimization**: This pillar helps you select the most appropriate and
  right number of resources to grow and scale without overspending, and how to
  identify and retire suboptimal resources.

- **Operational excellence**: In the end, it’s all about business value, which
  comes from improving business operations. This pillar focuses on managing and
  automating changes and growth, defining goals and metrics, optimizing
  operations, and defining business standards.

### Aligning IT and business goals

The WAF is a critical process for businesses to go through when moving resources
to AWS. It enables you to review and improve your cloud-based architectures and
better understand the business impact of your design decisions. We’ve led dozens
of companies through the WAF and have learned how to refine the process to maximize
results. We start with general design principles and move on to specific best
practices and guidance within each pillar to ensure that your technology and
business goals will be well-served.
