The dramatic cost savings that cloud computing can deliver is driving more and
more companies to migrate more resources to the cloud, including turning to
cloud consulting companies for managed services.

While IT leaders used to think in terms of maintaining servers and data
centers, outsourcing these resources to cloud platforms like Amazon Web
Services&reg; (AWS) has freed them to focus more narrowly on delivering the
services that businesses need to grow and thrive.

### Outsourcing AWS services on the rise

This shift is leading companies to outsource services on the cloud as well as
the infrastructure itself&mdash;especially services that are not part of the
company’s core business. Website
[Channel E2E](https://www.channele2e.com/technology/predictions/top-10-managed-services-provider-msp-predictions-for-2017/)
predicts that AWS managed services will grow from $107 billion in 2014 to
nearly $200 billion in 2019, and even more in 2020. Analysts at
[Technavio](https://www.technavio.com/report/global-cloud-computing-global-cloud-spending-smbs-market-2016-2020)
point to *a shift towards service-oriented architecture as one of the primary factors impacting the growth of this market.*

As businesses come to recognize that migrating data centers to the cloud is
a journey, not an event, they are recognizing the value of active management of
more and more of the cloud architecture. The key benefits of managed services include:

- **Proactive infrastructure management**: To get the most out of AWS, you need
  to be an expert at AWS. Services like system configuration, resource
  optimization, security and patch management, access control, automation, and
  disaster recovery are areas of specialization among AWS partners, and AWS
  partners can manage them much more efficiently because they are trained and
  certified in each discipline.

- **Ongoing business evolution support**: The cloud thrives on change. Your
  business needs will evolve and change, sometimes rapidly, requiring more or new
  resources and shifting workloads among different AWS products. Spinning up
  new resources and taking down underused resources are key to making your
  cloud infrastructure efficient and cost-effective. Managed service providers
  that have been involved in hundreds of AWS environments will have a deep
  understanding of how to make your infrastructure more productive and efficient.

- **Cloud operations management**: The cloud is not just about infrastructure. It’s
  about people and processes too. Roles and responsibilities need to evolve. AWS
  partners can train internal staff as well as define processes that will support
  business-critical functions.

- **Contractual agreements that structure responsibilities**: It is best to have
  ground rules for unexpected events before they happen. On the cloud, this
  means documenting the specific parameters and minimum service levels for
  criteria like availability, response times, data access and ownership, disaster
  recovery expectations, and more. It’s important to involve your IT team in
  defining service levels as what you get from an AWS partner should be clear
  on both sides and it should be better than what you can deliver with your
  own resources.

### And cost savings too

Of course, reducing operating expenses directly or indirectly is the benefit
of any IT project. Outsourcing non-core functions to an AWS partner can
pay dividends in reduced IT staff and equipment costs, but also indirect
savings through increased network uptime, better security and
protection, and better network performance. For more information see our blog and e-book,

### Future Proof Your Infrastructure

Migrating to a cloud environment is the first step in future-proofing
your data center. Making sure that the latest technology and services
are always available to your business is the next step. AWS is constantly
developing new products, updating existing products, and coming up with
new best practices to wring more efficiency from cloud environments. A
managed infrastructure can free IT departments from constant network
monitoring and resource management to focus on critical business operations.
