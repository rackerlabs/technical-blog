Many public cloud customers are struggling to control costs, facing common
challenges such as budget overruns or a lack of visibility into the drivers
of spend. While elasticity in peaks and valleys of usage is a major benefit
of a cloud environment, that same flexibility can cause you to incur costs
and overrun budgets in advance of organizations' ability to control
them. In order to effectively control cloud costs, you need the right
combination of measurement and governance tools.

### Eliminate cloud waste by accurately segmenting cloud spend

As practitioners of a relatively nascent discipline, some FinOps professionals
are developing basic forms of cloud cost chargeback. Others have implemented
automated governance, using software to enforce best practices. However, to
truly manage key business metrics such as product or service gross
margin, these two practices need to be combined into a holistic approach that
integrates chargeback with incentive compensation packages. Implementation of
segmentation strategies that accurately trace the cost of resources back
to specific departments, products, or services is the first&mdash;and most
critical&mdash;step in this process.

Thankfully, the ability to segment IT spend with granularity is one of the
great benefits of cloud computing relative to the comparatively imprecise
process of allocating a large block of central IT spend to products or
services as an overhead allocation. After cloud spend is completely
allocated, organizations achieve the following advantages:

- **Greater transparency into cloud spend**: Segmentation makes cloud spend
  data much more useful to managers who want to identify cost drivers. For
  example, if you're responsible for budgeting and forecasting,
  segmentation can clearly show what areas are driving costs so you
  can plan accordingly.

- **Ease of management**: FinOps practitioners find the process of
  [managing and optimizing their cloud spend](https://onica.com/blog/cost/top-6-aws-cost-optimization-tips/)
  is easier when you segment and trace that spend to technical and financial
  Responsible Parties (RPs). If you're seeing red all over your monthly cloud
  bill, thoroughly segmented cloud spend allows you to quickly identify
  those areas that are creating the most expenses to help you triage budget
  overruns with greater accuracy and speed.

- **Opportunity to optimize**: When you accurately trace costs to individual
  technical managers, businesses can surface and execute on new optimization
  opportunities in real time. By relying on technical-performance data (as
  opposed to financial-cost data), you can often realise these benefits before
  you significantly exceed your budget.

### The end game: Managing profitability

For every FinOps professional, the ability to quickly and accurately manage and
measure directly on the gross margin should be the ultimate goal. By creating
greater insight into cloud spend through segmentation, business leaders across
the firm can better measure and manage product and service
profitability and can facilitate far superior governance, budgeting, and
forecasting. This is why it’s essential that anyone considering a move to the
cloud has a well-developed strategy for segmenting cloud spend. That strategy
begins with assembling the right combination of FinOps capabilities.
