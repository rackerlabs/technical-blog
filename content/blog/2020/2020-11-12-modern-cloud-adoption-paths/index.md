Cloud computing has been one of the more prominent technological phenomena in
recent years. Companies across geographies and industries are turning to
cloud services to access a range of features and capabilities that augment
their products, simplify management, improve ROI, reduce capital
expenditure, and significantly improve scalability to meet rapidly growing
demand.

In a company’s quest to unlock these benefits, organizations are embarking on
their own cloud-migration journeys. Because each journey is unique, it’s important
to realize that cloud adoption isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Realizing
the cloud-computing benefits depends on each organization’s unique
business model, timeline, and other dependencies portrayed by their legacy
software and applications. Companies must carefully consider their objectives
when adopting the cloud: what migration path will help you fulfill your
goals, and what considerations lie beyond technological adoption?

### There is more than one path to cloud adoption

After considering the viability of the cloud for your business objectives, the
next step involves assessing the various paths of cloud migration that differ
in speed, comprehensiveness, and outcomes. As we explore the spectrum of
cloud adoption approaches, we’ve identified several distinct approaches that
organizations tend to follow&mdash;each with their own benefits and tradeoffs.

{{<img src="MCA-Blog-Image-1.png" title="" alt="">}}

- **Life and shift**: Copy and paste legacy workloads and processes to the
  cloud. This approach gets you to the cloud quickly but comes with very
  few actual cloud benefits.

- **Refactor**: Identify *low hanging fruit* to modernize with minimal effort.
  Easily replace legacy infrastructure with cloud PaaS services.

- **Containers**: Modernize server management and configuration and automate
  application deployment with no rewrite required.

- **Serverless**: Manage code only, with no servers required. With this fully
  managed approach, you pay for only what you consume, not what you
  provision.

While the lift-and-shift approach may sound like the path of least
resistance, this method yields many fewer cloud benefits and carries
forward much of the same fragility and static nature found in the data
center. On the other end of the spectrum, companies might choose to go fully
cloud-native and use infrastructure technology such as serverless computing
or containers, refactoring their applications to work effectively in these
environments. This approach might require more upfront consideration but
yields significant improvements in scalability, reliability, portability,
efficiency, and ROI in the long run.

As these approaches veer towards cloud-native infrastructures, they tend to
require an upfront investment of increased time and effort to manage the
initial complexity. However, you realize the payoff in the long-term benefits
that offer a well-structured migration, which is future-proof and offers
access to more advantages derived from the cloud.

### The benefits of cloud native

{{<img src="MCA-Blog-Image-2.png" title="" alt="">}}

If your business could greatly benefit from the cloud’s unique capabilities,
going cloud native and adopting technologies such as containers and serverless
computing to host your applications can yield the greatest value. Your
organization’s data, now stored on data lakes, can not only feed your
applications and workloads, but it can also feed into machine learning and data
analytics algorithms to derive insights to improve business
processes and discover untapped opportunities. Furthermore, cloud-native
approaches enhance tasks, such as security monitoring and application
development, streamlining and accelerating them through automation and agile
development workflows.

Going cloud native allows you to leverage event-driven architectures so that
you pay only when events are triggered, minimizing expenditure on idle
resources. The pace of innovation is also significantly improved through
accelerated iteration releases and new feature development. By representing
services and Infrastructure-as-code, environments become repeatable. Because you can
launch them in minutes, development teams can spin up environments
concurrently and perform tests without having to wait for procurement, allowing
them to verify, package, and deploy application versions to production quickly.

### Evolving beyond technology

Adopting a cloud-native strategy means that you have to implement changes beyond
just the technology. You might need organizational changes across people and processes
for an effective and prudent migration.

Your company should organize teams to follow an agile approach, removing
blockages and hurdles wherever possible. Teams might also need to take
application ownership from development to production, and members might need to
acquire new skill sets to develop effectively on the cloud. Employ processes such as
agile delivery, DevOps culture, CI/CD, and rapid iteration in weekly sprints
to avoid creating process bottlenecks when trying to achieve the full pace of
delivery afforded by the cloud. Finally, implement automation, by using
pipelines such as Migration-as-code and Infrastructure-as-code, as well as
automating application testing to maximize the acceleration of innovation and time
to production.

### What's next?

The next step is to choose a strategy to move your workloads and applications
effectively, minimizing disruption and maximizing realized benefits. These
can range from developing a cloud foundation for proofs-of-concept to
deploying existing applications into best-practice-defined landing zones.
By using Migration-as-code pipelines, you can undertake large scale migrations
of many applications in a controlled but expedited manner. For all-new
applications and development, greenfield application development enables you
to leverage all the powerful and unique cloud-native features such as
continuous scalability. It also offers the flexibility of event-driven architectures,
where you pay for only the resources you use, realizing savings when workloads are idle.

To learn about these strategies in detail or gain more insights into how you
can implement an optimal cloud migration for your business, watch our

This webinar dives deeper into the various paths to cloud adoption and discusses
AWS tools and accelerators, such as the Pre-Migration Cost Assessment or
the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework that guides you through your migration effort.
