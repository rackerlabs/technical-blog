Many companies hesitate when deciding whether to outsource certain functions or to do them in-house. Hiring Database as a Service (DBaaS) is one of those situations when you might have trouble deciding what to do. This post describes Pros and Cons of DBaaS.

### Pros and Cons of database as a service (DBAAS)

{{<img src="picture1.jpg" title="" alt="">}}

A question many companies face as they start out (especially tech-based companies) is whether they want to outsource certain functions or do them in-house. Making this decision can sometimes be difficult because it can seem expensive whether to hire your own crew or to pay another company to get things done.

When it comes to databases, though, things can get messy quite quickly if they’re not managed properly. So to help you identify if database as a service (DBaaS) is a good option for your company, we’re going to go over some pros and cons.

#### Why do you need a Database? 

A database is a computer system used to store indexed information. In the age of big data, there’s a lot of information that needs storing. More importantly, you need to retrieve that information reliably and use it to make business decisions. Databases make this possible by allowing you to store, organize, manipulate, and retrieve the data you collect in your daily business processes.

Databases come typically in one of two flavors: SQL, and NoSQL. SQL (or Search Query Language) is a programming language used to build some databases. It’s useful, and in many use cases, critical, depending on the work being done. Even though, it lacks the flexibility needed for certain situations, SQL creates rigid, reliable databases.

A NoSQL database like MongoDB is more flexible, and can make changes on the fly, allowing for queries and information pulls to be situational. While it’s not suitable for every use case, for many instances that added adaptability, it allows for unique source database management and useful data manipulation.

#### What is DBaaS?

This is simply when a company, the Database as a service company (DBaaS), provides equipment, software, and infrastructure for businesses to run their database on the DBaaS, rather than putting something together in-house.

If a company wanted to run a database in-house, for example, they would have to buy and assemble all the hardware, purchase and install all the software, foot the power bill, as well as building their own database system, using either SQL or noSQL. That’s a great number of developer manhours, and it might be a problem if you don’t have SQL developers on staff.

#### Advantages of DBaaS

Using a DBaaS, you won't have to:

* Buy your own equipment or software licenses
* Use your own database developers
* Build a database system
* Hire a large IT crew to maintain the system
* Pay elevated power bills for running all the servers
* Worry about not having uptime guarantees
* Worry about handling a variety of bugs and problems because DBaaS teams are experienced 
* Concern yourself with loss of power or natural disasters
* Concern yourself with the use of dated equipment because DBaaS uses top-notch servers and hardware, better than most small businesses

You can see why businesses that can’t spare the manpower to run their own database would choose to outsource. That doesn’t mean in-house databases don’t have value though.

#### Disadvantages of DBaaS

The primary disadvantage to a DBaaS over an in-house solution is a matter of control—you don’t have direct access to the servers that are running your database. This means you don’t have direct influence over the physical safety of those servers, or the cyber security that protects sensitive data. If, for whatever reason, their system goes down, you don’t have access to your database. Lastly, there’s the issue of cost-at-scale: once a business reaches a certain size, it becomes more economical to build their own database and run it themselves (like Google does).

These are primarily concerns that affect companies that have the expertise to rival the DBaaS, and the size to justify their own server warehouse. Smaller to mid-sized companies will still likely find that running their own database will be cost prohibitive.

#### When to Use a DBaaS

When you’re making the decision to [outsource your database](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/mongodb/factors-to-consider-when-choosing-database-as-a-service-dbaas/), the main factor you need to consider is this: can the DBaaS do a better job providing database services than you can? If you’re a Silicon Valley giant with an army of developers and IT admins, then by all means, build a database unique to your needs and fill a warehouse with servers to run it.

Most of us, though, aren’t quite there yet. And even with larger companies that can afford to field their own database team, it’s sometimes more cost effective to outsource the labor and maintenance to experts who already have the infrastructure to handle the work. Just like you’d hire a plumber or electrician to help remodel your home, [you’ll want to trust experts](https://app.objectrocket.com/sign_up?_ga=2.164666111.1797400172.1603119104-1358969005.1602515327) in the field who already possess the proper tools to help your business run at peak efficiency.
