Many companies hesitate when deciding whether to outsource certain functions or to do them in-house. Considering
Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is one of those situations when you might have trouble deciding what to do.

A question many companies face as they start out (especially tech-based companies) is whether they want to outsource
certain functions or do them in-house. Making this decision can sometimes be difficult because it can seem expensive
to hire your own crew or pay another company to get things done.

When it comes to databases, though, things can get messy quite quickly if you don't manage them properly. So to help
you identify if DBaaS is a good option for your company, we’re going to go over some pros and cons.

#### Why do you need a database? 

A database is a computer system used to store indexed information. In the age of big data, lots of information
needs to be stored. More importantly, you need to retrieve that information reliably and use it to make business decisions.
Databases make this possible by allowing you to store, organize, manipulate, and retrieve the data you collect in your
daily business processes.

Databases typically come in one of two flavors: Search Query Language (SQL) and NoSQL. SQL is a programming language used
to build some databases. It’s useful, and in many use cases, critical, depending on the work you're doing. Even though it
lacks the flexibility needed for certain situations, SQL creates rigid, reliable databases.

A NoSQL database like MongoDB&reg; is more flexible and can make changes on the fly, allowing for queries and information
pulls to be situational. While it’s not suitable for every use case, for many instances that added adaptability allows for
unique source database management and useful data manipulation.

#### What is DBaaS?

A DBaaS company provides equipment, software, and infrastructure for businesses to run their database on the DBaaS-company
infrastructure, rather than putting something together in-house.

If a company wanted to run a database in-house, for example, they would have to buy and assemble all the hardware, purchase and
install all the software, foot the power bill, as well as building their own database system, using either SQL or NoSQL. That’s
a bunch of developer hours, and it might be a problem if you don’t have SQL developers on staff.

#### Advantages of DBaaS

Using a DBaaS, you won't have to:

* Buy your own equipment or software licenses
* Use your own database developers
* Build a database system
* Hire a large IT crew to maintain the system
* Pay elevated power bills for running all the servers
* Worry about not having uptime guarantees
* Worry about handling a variety of bugs and problems because DBaaS teams have experience 
* Concern yourself with loss of power or natural disasters
* Concern yourself with the use of dated equipment because DBaaS uses top-notch servers and hardware, better than most small businesses

You can see why businesses that can’t spare the manpower to run their own database would choose to outsource. That doesn’t mean
in-house databases don’t have value, though.

#### Disadvantages of DBaaS

The primary disadvantage of DBaaS over an in-house solution is a matter of control&mdash;you don’t have direct access to the
servers running your database. This means you don’t have direct influence over the physical safety of those servers or the
cybersecurity that protects sensitive data. If for whatever reason, the DBaaS system goes down, you don’t have access to your
database. Lastly, there’s the issue of cost-at-scale: After a business reaches a certain size, it becomes more economical for it
to build its own database and run it themselves (like Google&reg; does).

These are primarily concerns that affect companies with the expertise to rival the DBaaS and the size to justify their own
server warehouse. Smaller to mid-sized companies will still likely find that running their own database is cost prohibitive.

#### When to Use a DBaaS

When you’re deciding to 
[outsource your database](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/mongodb/factors-to-consider-when-choosing-database-as-a-service-dbaas/),
the main factor you need to consider is this: Can the DBaaS do a better job providing database services than you can? If you’re
a Silicon Valley giant with an army of developers and IT admins, then, by all means, build a database unique to your needs and fill
a warehouse with servers to run it.

Most of us, though, aren’t quite there yet. And even with larger companies that can afford to field their own database team, it’s
sometimes more cost effective to outsource the labor and maintenance to experts who already have the infrastructure to handle the
work. Just like you’d hire a plumber or electrician to help remodel your home,

in the field who already possess the proper tools to help your business run at peak efficiency.
