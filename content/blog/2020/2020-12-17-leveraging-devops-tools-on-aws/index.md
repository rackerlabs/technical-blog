AWS&reg; defines DevOps as the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an
organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.

Especially for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) software companies, DevOps is one of the primary drivers for moving
to the cloud. Accelerating product development can give software companies a competitive edge with faster
time-to-market for products and features.

On AWS&reg;, DevOps tools accelerate innovation by enabling developers to change, test, and push code in an automated
fashion. This enables businesses to rapidly develop and deploy services and applications much faster than in a
traditional software development environment.

### AWS DevOps tools

While DevOps is not unique to AWS, AWS has multiple tools and best practices to make DevOps easier and more
effective, especially when it comes to automation of application development and delivery. The core best
practice is an approach to DevOps continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). A CI/CD approach
enables you to continually update applications and services to introduce new features, fix bugs, and respond
to customer needs.

SaaS products have forever changed how businesses buy and use applications&mdash;internally and externally. Gone
are the days of shrink-wrapped DVDs. SaaS products are constantly available online with automatic updates and new
releases. AWS DevOps code tools enable companies to create a CI/CD environment that gives developers complete
control of their products, allowing them to deploy new code to give end-users the latest and greatest features.

#### CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit&reg; is a source control system that allows companies to create their own Git code repositories,
automating the management and security of source code without the need to create their own source code systems.
CodeCommit is compatible with third-party Git tools.

#### CodeBuild 

AWS CodeBuild&reg; eliminates the need to build your own servers to compile, test, and deliver applications. CodeBuild
runs tests and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. It scales continuously and processes multiple
applications at the same time. You can use templated environments or customize environments to use code-building tools.

#### CodeDeploy

AWS CodeDeploy&reg; automates code deployment to AWS instances&mdash;to one or thousands of instances and even on-site
servers. This vastly simplifies application updates throughout your AWS or hybrid infrastructure, eliminating the need
for painstaking manual deployment.

#### CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline&reg; builds, tests, and deploys code automatically anytime there is a code change, based on the criteria
you define. It serves as a CI/CD service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. You can deliver new
features or versions faster and more reliably and even create and test a complete solution using built-in or custom plugins
for services like GitHub&reg;.

#### CodeStar

CodeStar&reg; bundles the AWS code tools together into one easy to address workflow. CodeStar makes it easy to create new
projects by using templates that include selected programming languages that provision the AWS services needed for the
application. It also implements appropriate IAM access policies to ensure a secure application environment. This enables you
to automate the configuration of a continuous delivery pipeline for projects using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS
CodePipeline, and AWS CodeDeploy.

#### Cloud9

Cloud9 is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.
Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript&reg;, Python&reg;,
PHP&reg;, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Because
your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected
machine. With Cloud9, you can quickly share your development environment with your team, allowing you to pair program and track
each others’ inputs in real-time. Cloud9 integrates with CodeStar, allowing you to quickly set up an end-to-end continuous
delivery toolchain for your application and start releasing code faster on AWS.

AWS DevOps tools make it possible to dramatically improve the speed, quality, and usability of applications and services for
internal and external users. Adopting a CI/CD approach and environment for application development and using the AWS code
tools makes it possible for businesses to rapidly and automatically innovate, change, test, and push code to build elastic
and highly scalable applications.
