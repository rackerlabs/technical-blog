Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS) released the **Well-Architected Framework** (WAF)
in 2012 to help customers understand the thinking needed to properly leverage AWS capabilities.

<!--more-->

As an AWS well-architected partner, Onica, a Rackspace Technology company, is
excited to announce an update to our well-architected review and framework. Released by
AWS in 2012, the well-architected framework (WAF) helps customers understand
how to properly leverage AWS capabilities. A comprehensive guide created
from 11 years of collected AWS knowledge on how to best operate, AWS’ WAF
whitepaper and documentation outline best practices for architecting your cloud presence. 

However, it’s ultimately up to individual businesses to align these best practices
with their business requirements.

For businesses just getting started on AWS, the WAF is a good place to start the
planning process and build a strong foundation for a scalable, flexible cloud presence
that will meet technical and business needs. For businesses already on the cloud,
you might have to work backward to achieve a well-architected implementation.

### What are the pillars of the AWS well-architected framework?

The five pillars of the AWS well-architected framework are:

1. Operational excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance efficiency
5. Cost optimization

By optimizing your architecture around these pillars, you gain the benefits of a
well-architected design in the cloud, including:

- Remove guesswork around capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automation for easier architectural experimentation
- Evolutionary architectures options
- Data-driven architectures
- Game-day improvement

#### What is an AWS well-architected review?

Cloud architects should review their architecture regularly to identify any
critical issues needing attention or opportunities for improvement. The outcome
of an AWS well-architected review is a set of actions aiming to improve the
experience of a customer using the workload. The AWS well-architected tool
(AWS WA Tool) is a service that provides a consistent process to review and
measure your architecture using AWS best practices. The tool gives you specific
suggestions to improve workloads, making them more reliable, secure, efficient,
and cost-effective.

#### How Rackspace Onica’s WAF works

We build the Rackspace Onica WAF around the AWS WAF. We ask a series of
open-ended questions and use your answers to assess how well your
architecture is aligned to AWS tools and best practices. The design process requires
companies to weigh the pros and cons of different approaches to meeting business
goals, prioritizing objectives, and assessing tradeoffs among and between the five pillars. 

For example, you might decide to postpone cost optimization because time-to-market is a
higher priority; or you could trade consistency, durability, and space versus time or
latency, to deliver higher performance.

#### Assessing AWS architecture wellness

A well-architected review has a solution architect assess your cloud architecture
against AWS best practices and your own business needs and give recommendations
for improvement. If you’re moving to AWS for the first time, this includes
guidance to help you design reliable, secure, efficient and cost-effective systems in the cloud.

Here at Onica, we offer well-architected framework reviews for businesses of any
size. The Onica well-architected review is designed to educate customers on
architectural best practices for building and operating reliable, secure, efficient,
and cost-effective systems in the cloud and to assess their current workloads.

Onica’s process uses the AWS WAF principles and tools to deliver a comprehensive
review of one workload. A workload is a set of machines, instances, or servers that
together enable the delivery of a service or application to internal or external
customers. Examples include an e-commerce website, business application, web
application, and so on. Through this review and guidance from the AWS
well-architected framework, Onica provides the customer with an analysis of the
workload through the lens of the WAF pillars, as well as a plan to address areas
that don't comply with framework recommendations.

#### Onica’s well-architected review

Onica's well-architected review includes:

- A one day on-site, in-person review and architecture deep-dive with your
  stakeholders to gather data on your workloads in your business/IT context.

- Up to three days of analysis of the collected data, cross-analysis of the workload
  via the guidance offered by the framework, and formulation of any recommended
  remediation, if applicable.

- A review and analysis document, outlining all findings and recommendations
