Rackspace Technology is on a journey with our customers. We are expanding our
Fanatical Experience&trade; and networking and security expertise from the data
center to the virtual appliance arena and the cloud.

<!--more-->

### The way it is

Every customer has a personal timeline to take advantage of the cloud. As
customers move more of their workloads into a multi-cloud and multi-location
deployment, now, more than ever, they rely on Rackspace expertise to manage
their networking and security needs. Today, customers enjoy our ability to apply
very complex and rigid standards of excellence to service gear within our data
center walls.

As we move together to the future, we are including virtual appliances that we
can deploy in public clouds, such as AWS and Azure, under the umbrella of the
same level of excellence and support.

We have listened to our customers, who ask your requests for the following
options:

- More cloud-savvy solutions
- Scalable options to meet varying performance requirements
- Entry-level price and performance options

### What's coming

Rackspace Technology is now poised to bring our team of experts to the forefront
of supporting your cloud infrastructure networking and security requirements,
such as the following elements:

- **Scalable performance and functionality:** You can deploy a virtual appliance
  on a public cloud infrastructure with flexible licensing to make it easy to
  up-size or down-size an implementation as needed.

- **Enable virtual infrastructure:** You can take full advantage of virtualized
  servers and associated resources that are already in place with virtual
  application delivery controllers.

To support our partners' solutions, during the first half of 2020, we launched
Citrix&reg; VPX options on the Rackspace private cloud offerings, VMWare&reg;
and Hyper-V&reg;.  By doing this limited release, we challenged our Network
Security support teams, and they have excelled at every opportunity.

### Conclusion

Our solutions team continues to work hard, making Networking Security a reality
for our customers on their cloud journey. You can choose the native power from
your clouds of choice and receive consistent networking and security support
across our partner platform.
