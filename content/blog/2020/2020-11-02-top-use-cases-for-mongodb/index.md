Creating consistently good customer experiences has become a key challenge for many organizations. The reality is that our
expectations around what a good customer experience is has increased dramatically over the past few years. What used to be
cool and different is now the norm. Data aggregation is key to those awesome experiences.

In this post, we’ll explain some of the most common MongoDB&reg; use cases we come across and different characteristics that
influence these choices.

### Customer analytics

Data aggregation is one of the keys to creating amazing customer experiences. Companies collect massive amounts of data
about their existing and potential customers and aggregate it with publicly available data. This data can tell companies
how customers interact with products (digitally and in-person), personal preferences, demographics, and so on. From all
of this disparate data, companies build customer profiles and nurture paths to get the customer to buy more products.  

With all of this data coming from different sources with different schemas, tying it all together at such a massive scale
is a huge challenge. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability provide a solution. MongoDB allows for the aggregation of this
data and building analytical tools to create amazing customer experiences. MongoDB’s speed allows for dynamic experiences
that can evolve based upon customer behavior in real-time.

### Product catalog

Product catalogs are not new to the evolving digital experience. What is new is the volume and richness of the data that
feeds the interactions in product catalogs that we use today. MongoDB provides a great tool to store many different types
of objects with different sets of attributes. Its dynamic schema capability allows for product documents to only contain
attributes that are relevant to that product. Gone are the days of needing every product record to contain every possible
attribute. MongoDB users can very quickly and easily make changes to their catalogs, providing a better, more straightforward
experience for developers and customers.

### Real-time data integration

Vast amounts of data spread across companies and their organizations. A *single view* aggregation provides value and convenience
to organizations. Previously, companies spent energy and resources on data ingestion, transformation, and schema changes to obtain
a single data source. MongoDB’s flexibility and query capabilities make it easy to aggregate this data and create the tools that
make organizations more efficient. This real-time aggregation provides a single view of their data. With the addition of change
streams starting with MongoDB 3.6, developers can now monitor and take action on specific events quickly.

### Mobility and scaling

With most mobile application development, companies are dealing with varying data structures that come from multiple sources and
potentially highly dynamic growth. The flexibility and scalability of MongoDB provide a great database solution for dealing with
this type of environment. With schemas that can evolve, mobile application developers don’t have to spend time adjusting the database.
Instead, developers can focus on developing the customer experience.

### Rackspace ObjectRocket for MongoDB

Today, modern businesses are thinking about better ways to store and manage their data, gain better customer insights, adapt to
changing user expectations, and beat competitors to market with new applications. MongoDB is a great tool that many companies find
useful, but managing MongoDB doesn’t fit into everyone’s business model. It’s hard to find the right expertise, and many companies
can’t afford to hire the headcount. Rackspace ObjectRocket for MongoDB can help. No matter where you host your app, we can help you
get the most from your data.
