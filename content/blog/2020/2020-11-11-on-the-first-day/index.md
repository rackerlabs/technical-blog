We’re pleased to announce that the Rackspace ObjectRocket platform is generally available on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)! I’ve written a number of [blogposts](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/) about our new hosting platform as we launched new services and features, but one of the primary goals of this project has been a platform that we could drop into multiple clouds. Now, we prove that capability with the addition of GCP as a supported cloud provider.

You can expect an equivalent experience between cloud providers on our platform, so the choice of which cloud to use is yours. Our goal has always been to move the database closer to your application, and now we can get even closer to GCP customers’ environments.

#### What's next?

So much of what we do at ObjectRocket is directly driven by our customer feedback, so I’d like to reiterate that we’re always listening and if there’s a feature, or product, or region that you don’t see listed, just ask. Nothing motivates us more than delivering on a customer request. After all, it is the season of giving.
