On May 12th we held a Lunch + Lab event in Santa Monica, at the Amazon&reg;
offices on scaling Windows&reg; Workloads in Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS).
The agenda included a technical presentation from our CTO and AWS
Solutions Architect Kevin Epstein, an interactive demonstration on how to
quickly scale large volumes of Windows workloads in AWS using PowerShell
and EC2 Run Command, and a discussion on AWS best practices and making
the business case for AWS managed services in your organization.

After the presentation, attendees enjoyed lunch and asked our AWS Reps and
technical experts questions about their AWS environments. The event drew a mix
of CEOs, CTOs, developers, engineers, and many AWS enthusiasts.

### Key takeaways from our conversations with event attendees

Automation is on people's minds. Organizations consistently do more with
less. In the case of Windows, there are many challenges around some legacy
security models’ dependency on active directory, reboot pains, heavy software
packages, and only being able to bootstrap to a point. 

The DevOps process is helping solve some of these challenges as we start
thinking of our *infrastructure as code* and follow a well-defined pattern
of build, test, and deploy&mdash;with automated testing as the goal. AWS makes
the DevOps process easy. Tools like AWS OpsWorks, EC2 Simple Systems
Manager, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy
are helping IT to innovate faster, increase the number of deployments, decrease
the time between deployments, and automate to consistently deliver stable
predictable, and secure environments.

### Scaling Windows Workloads in AWS

At Onica, a Rackspace Technology company, we have put together a document
where you can find some of the Scaling Windows Workloads workshop
[highlights](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/corpinfowebsiteuploads/content/uploads/2016/05/13124342/Automating-Microsoft-Environments-in-AWS.pdf).

Whether you’re running Microsoft Windows, SQL Server, Exchange, SharePoint,
or custom .NET applications, you can rely on the secure global infrastructure
of Amazon Web Services to easily run any Microsoft Windows Server applications
in the cloud. 

With tools like Windows PowerShell and Amazon EC2 Run Command, IT can quickly
scale their current environment and enjoy all of the benefits AWS has to
offer for management, administration, workload reliability, visibility, and
cross-platform support.
