On June 9th, Rackspace Technology introduced support for Cisco&reg; Defense
Orchestrator (CDO).

<!--more-->

### Overview

CDO enables Rackspace Technology to give you unprecedented, direct access to
your security devices while simplifying customer-management responsibilities and
scaling IT management costs.

CDO can manage the following security devices from Cisco:

- Physical and virtual Cisco ASA devices
- Cisco Firepower&reg; Threat Defense
- Meraki&reg; appliances
- AWS&reg; security groups

### How CDO helps

This offering provides customers who have deployed security appliances across
multiple-clouds, Rackspace data centers, or corporate data centers with a single
point of control and visibility control panel to see real-time stats. It also
enables you to manage and apply unified security policies.

The combination of TLS encryption and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) through
Cisco Duo® provide secure access to your security appliances through the CDO portal.
You can also configure access for Single-Sign-On (SSO).

Today’s modern workflows require both the convenience of an intuitive GUI for
point-in-time changes and more modern continuous integration/continuous delivery
(CI/CD) approaches to security. Through the CDO application programmer interface
(API), you have the flexibility to work your security instances into your security
orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) processes and SecOps and DevOps
workflows.

### Features

CDO allows Rackspace and customers alike to reduce overhead while managing their
security policies, offering the following advantages:

- **Configuration hygiene**: Use built-in filters to analyze policies and
  objects across security devices to identify duplicate objects and
  inconsistencies, which aids in identifying security gaps, errors, and omissions.

- **Deploy devices faster**: Deploy new devices faster by creating standard
  policy templates.

- **Simplify upgrades**: Conduct firewall software image upgrades with just a
  few clicks and complete them in real-time&mdash;or schedule them at your
  convenience.

- **Track every change**: View the changelog to see all the continuously
  documented changes made over time through the CDO portal. Rollback to a
  last-known-good configuration at any time.
  
- **Improve security**: Apply policy and objects across multiple devices and
  locations, enabling consistent security postures and configurations.

### Conclusion

As we take this step into CDO management for our Cisco and expanded security
appliances, Rackspace will lean more on our security partners to deliver
scalable, efficient, and secure solutions. By doing so, we can meet your needs
faster and provide Fanatical Experience&trade; and expert security knowledge
across multiple clouds and physical infrastructures. This, in turn, opens up the
opportunity for Rackspace Technology to support security appliances anywhere you
deploy them in the future.
