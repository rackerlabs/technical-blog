Can you confidently say your collaboration platform and data are secure? Over
55 percent of small and medium-sized businesses are attacked every year, and 60
percent of cyber-attacks begin with a breached device, according to Microsoft®.

In a world where companies need to operate more efficiently every day and use
their mobile devices while they are on the go, businesses must have a secure and
connected platform.

Microsoft 365&reg; offers a secure platform with various solutions such as
productivity tools (like Excel®, Word®, Teams®, and Outlook®) and security
enhancement options like *threat protection* and *data loss prevention*. As a
Microsoft partner since 2001 and a five-time Microsoft Hosting Partner of the
Year, Rackspace Technology has developed a Microsoft 365 Readiness Assessment to
advise you on the tools and options Microsoft 365 can provide your business
operations team.

### Microsoft 365 for your business

Microsoft 365 includes many features to help you manage your enterprise content
and collaboration, but you need planning and experience to take advantage of
them. Companies in highly regulated industries like financial services, healthcare,
pharmaceuticals, and defense need to comply with multiple layers of regulation
and internal policies. It's critical to understand how to configure Microsoft
365 and, in some cases, to extend it with customizations that automatically
enforce business rules.

Different businesses have different priorities. One company might have more
substantial mobile-device-protection requirements and want to consider tools
such as Intune® or conditional access policies based on location. Another
organization might need to develop better policies around data loss prevention
and block users from sending emails with social security numbers. Our Microsoft
365 Readiness Assessment enables us to gain a better understanding of your
business priorities.

### Key assessment features

The assessment includes the following important features:

- **Customer success workshop**: To gain a better understanding of your business
and priorities, we gather information about your vision, goals, pain points, and
timelines. Then, we define the appropriate success criteria. We also provide an
overview of Microsoft 365 licenses and requirements.

- **Identity and access management readiness**: Whether you currently have an
environment or want to set up a new environment, we review Active Directory
requirements. We also gather information on advanced security features like
conditional access policies and advanced authentication capabilities.

- **Messaging readiness**: We collect your requirements around messaging
configuration and migration options. For example, we help define a migration
path and the appropriate configuration for Microsoft Exchange&reg;.

- **Teams readiness**: To encourage productive collaboration, we can configure
the collaboration tool, Teams, which works with SharePoint® and has video and chat
capabilities. The tool's flexibility enables us to focus this readiness effort
on security, compliance, and governance objectives.

- **File sharing and collaboration readiness**: As with Microsoft Teams,
OneDrive® and SharePoint are collaborative cloud tools that enhance productivity
when properly designed and structured. This workshop investigates governance,
security, and compliance objectives and looks at migration options for current
resources.

### Next Steps

Microsoft has long enabled remote workers and work-from-home scenarios, building
products and solutions that allow workers to remain productive no matter where
they are located. But how do you take advantage of these great tools efficiently
and effectively? We are here to advise you. Our architects focus on the following
elements:

- The Microsoft Cloud platform
- Cloud productivity
- Collaboration and content
- Enterprise mobility management
- Communications
- Messaging

We view security as the foundation for all of these productivity services. With
that foundation, you can focus on what you do best&mdash;growing your business.
