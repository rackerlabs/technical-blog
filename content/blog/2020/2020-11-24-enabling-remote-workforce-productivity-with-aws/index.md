A large majority of the global workforce has begun to work remotely. Despite the quick and urgent change, experienced, top cloud providers such as AWS&reg; are helping facilitate a smooth transition through their suite of services. If you are an organization that utilizes legacy software and applications to run the bulk of your business activities, and don't have a remote work plan in place, now is an important time to look at what options are available to support your employees to help them maintain productivity, while avoiding further workforce disruption.

### What business challenges are you facing?

From large corporations to small businesses, organizations from around the world are looking for secure remote work solutions to help with a broad spectrum of challenges that vary based on their unique needs, goals, and abilities.

Some companies seek a highly effective, quick, and easy solution that can help them minimize the impact on productivity to avoid resulting losses. Others seek a temporary solution that allows their teams to access their existing tools and programs so that they can quickly revert back to their usual setups when the situation improves. On the other hand, some companies might find the need for access to proprietary legacy applications such as engineering software and **ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, while others may need shared provisioning so that applications can be divided between multiple workers to control costs.

Disruption in business continuity that results from any preceding situation can mean large losses in sales opportunities, production blockages, and diminishing customer satisfaction and trust.

#### Building business continuity with AWS

AWS has designed a plethora of services on its cloud platform to help you remain productive and connected while working from home. From virtualizing your desktops and online video conferencing to cloud-based call center routing, you can choose the right mix of products to support your business functions. Some of these solutions include:

+ **Amazon WorkSpaces** – Access your entire desktop anywhere, anytime, from any device.
+ **Amazon AppStream 2.0** – Secure application delivery to any supported device via a web browser including enterprise, educational or medical apps as well as support for apps that might require GPU computation.
* **AWS Client VPN** – AWS and on-prem connectivity from anywhere.**
