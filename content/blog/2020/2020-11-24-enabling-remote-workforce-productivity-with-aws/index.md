We live in a uniquely challenging world today, where we find ourselves in an unpredictable situation.
Organizations across industries have shown inspiring efforts with programs to support the fight against COVID-19 and
have implemented strategies to maintain productivity and customer delivery in these changing times.

A large majority of the global workforce has begun to work remotely. Despite the quick and urgent change, experienced,
top cloud providers such as AWS&reg; are helping facilitate a smooth transition through their suite of services. Suppose
your organization uses legacy software and applications to run the bulk of your business activities, and you don't have
a remote work plan in place. In that case, now is an important time to look at the available options to support your
employees and help them maintain productivity while avoiding further workforce disruption.

### What business challenges are you facing?

From large corporations to small businesses, organizations from around the world are looking for secure remote work
solutions to help with a broad spectrum of challenges that vary based on their unique needs, goals, and abilities.

Some companies seek a highly effective, quick, and easy solution to help them minimize the impact on productivity and avoid
the resulting losses. Others seek a temporary solution that allows their teams to access their existing tools and programs
so that they can quickly revert to their usual setups when the situation improves. On the other hand, some companies might
find they need access to proprietary legacy applications such as engineering software and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
systems, while others need shared provisioning so that they can divide applications between multiple workers to control costs.

Disruption in business continuity that results from any of the preceding situations can mean large losses in sales opportunities,
production blockages, and diminishing customer satisfaction and trust.

#### Building business continuity with AWS

AWS has designed a plethora of services on its cloud platform to help you remain productive and connected while working from home.
From virtualizing your desktops and online video conferencing to cloud-based call-center routing, you can choose the right mix of
products to support your business functions. Some of these solutions include:

+ **Amazon&reg; WorkSpaces&reg;**: Access your entire desktop anywhere, anytime, from any device.
+ **Amazon AppStream 2.0**: Secure application delivery to any supported device through a web browser, including enterprise,
  educational, or medical apps, as well as support for apps that might require GPU computation.
* **AWS Client VPN**: AWS and on-prem connectivity from anywhere.
