Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering
technology resources managed by experts and available on-demand. Their
services include compute power, database storage, content delivery, and
other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.

### What is the purpose of AWS?

Common uses for AWS include:

- Storing large amounts of public or private data
- Processing large datasets for business and scientific use
- Handling peak loads for e-commerce websites
- Hosting a static website which use client-side technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Hosting a dynamic application or website with web, application, and database tiers

### The benefits of moving to AWS

Why should you move your IT infrastructure into the
[AWS cloud](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/)? AWS delivers computing
resources as a service, liberating companies from devoting resources to activities
that don’t directly contribute to their bottom line. This allows companies
to focus on the core competency of their business instead of devoting
time, people, and money to IT-related projects. When using a cloud
infrastructure, users can access their data anytime and anywhere on the
web, without the limitations of a physical data center. They can also easily
scale up or down their IT needs based on their demand, whether it be
computing, data storage, or database services, keeping their IT investment and
operations lean and agile.

#### Low Cost

The first AWS benefit is about your bottom line. Instead of investing hundreds of
thousands of dollars on installing, configuring, and running on-premises servers, you
can begin running your operating system and enterprise applications on the AWS
platform with $0 up-front costs, paying only for the computing resources you use. You
can utilize services such as [Amazon CloudFront](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/cloudfront/)
for low-latency content delivery to users around the world. Amazon’s network of 77
global edge locations achieves lower latency and faster downloads automatically routes
requests for your content to the nearest servers and delivers content with the best
possible performance.

#### Elasticity

A traditional infrastructure requires you to predict the number of computing
resources your application will use over several years. If you underestimate, your
apps won't have the compute power needed to handle unexpected traffic, often
resulting in customer dissatisfaction due to slow load speeds. On the flip
side, if you overestimate, you are wasting money on superfluous resources. The
elastic pay-what-you-use nature of the cloud allows your infrastructure to align
closely with demand, providing both lean and agile IT operations. Amazon EC2’s
ability to instantly scale up or down instances enables you to quickly deploy new
applications by reserving as many computing resources as you need during the
[DevOps stage](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/devops/) of your project.

#### Flexibility

Another major AWS benefit is that the platform gives you the flexibility to use
programming models, operating systems, databases, and architectures you are probably
already familiar with. All AWS products and services are compatible with almost
every existing coding language, saving you from having to learn new codes and possible
data loss when transitioning to the cloud.

#### Security

AWS employs a shared responsibility model for data protection. They provide a globally
secure infrastructure while their customers are responsible for the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of their data in the cloud. Essentially, with the help of
AWS’s documented
[best practices and guidelines](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/corpinfowebsiteuploads/content/uploads/2016/02/29113220/CorpInfo-AWS-Well-Architected-Assessment.pdf),
customers are responsible for security *in* the cloud whereas AWS is responsible for
the security *of* the cloud. Most importantly, you can encrypt your data the way
you want and maintain full ownership and control of your content, meaning you can keep
your data in your preferred format and move it or delete it at any time without the
fear of automated data replication without your consent.

### Which is not a benefit of AWS cloud computing?

Cloud computing has benefited many enterprises by reducing costs, increasing
flexibility, providing high-quality security, and enabling a focus on core business
competencies, rather than IT and infrastructure issues. But there are some
potential disadvantages to cloud computing, especially for smaller
organizations. Unavoidable realities of off-premise infrastructure include
downtime, vendor dependency, control limitations, and cyber liability. Make sure
to build in time for research and planning to understand how the cloud will
affect your business.

The cloud computing experts at Onica, a Rackspace Technology company, can help you
understand these potential downsides and the best practices for mitigating any risks.
