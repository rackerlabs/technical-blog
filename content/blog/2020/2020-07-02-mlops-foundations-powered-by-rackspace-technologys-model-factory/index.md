It is becoming more and more important for businesses to use Machine Learning (ML) models to take advantage
of data’s predictive power. However, 60 percent of ML models never make it to production. These models often fail to deliver
the intended results because of inadequate considerations of the shift in people, processes, and platforms needed
to operate in a responsive, agile technology environment effectively. The new Rackspace ML Operations
Foundations offering (MLOps), powered by the Rackspace Technology Model Factory Framework, can help you innovate your
data landscape, even if you don't have all the technical expertise to move ML models into production efficiently.

Rackspace Technology built our Model Factory Framework with open source tools that enable rapid development,
training, scoring, and deployment of models. We can tailor the MLOps solution to specific workflows and business
needs through customization around the Model Factory Framework. Rackspace leverages the innovative capabilities of
the cloud to help customers build new revenue streams, increase efficiency, and deliver incredible experiences.
Rackspace teams employ industry best practices and a wide range of expertise across data migration, data engineering,
data science, ML, and operations to help turn your data into a tool for innovation.

### Features and benefits

**Standardized model development environment for your data science teams:** Allows your data science and
engineering teams to develop models with support for any ML framework.

**Automated model deployment across development, quality assurance (QA), and production environments:** Leverages hyper-scale
cloud automation to quickly take models from development to deployment, while addressing the production-ready
requirements of high availability, scalability, reliability, and cost management.

**Reproducibility of models and predictions:** Tracks model versions and hyper-parameters,
when deploying to different environments, ensuring that model performance in development matches model performance in production.

**Tools for diagnostics, performance monitoring, and addressing model drift:**  Provides tools for data science teams to address
model drift, model performance for debugging and troubleshooting, and pipeline management.

**Model explainability for governance and regulatory compliance:** Track models, data, and parameters to
show auditors that you employed the proper protocols.

**Platform for collaboration:** Combines DevOps tools and processes with ML workflows. Teams
can work closely together to develop complex models and pipelines and manage model progression through the
different development stages to production, with respective versions, annotations, and history.

**Accelerated ROI:** Expedite the use of models in production and realize the benefits of
an automated cloud-based ML lifecycle management solution with a pay-for-what-you-use
model. This feature includes tools and services to help you monitor and optimize your compute resources.


### Conclusion:

With MLOps, Rackspace can help you reduce the typical 25+ step lifecycle to 10 steps or less.
This efficiency allows you to put models into operation in production much more quickly.

The Model Factory Framework enables support for numerous ML models in production and development through
Continuous Integration/ Continuous Development (CI/CD) for data science and automated workflows for development,
QA, and production. Rackspace experts tailor this service to your specific workflows and business needs
while implementing relevant best practices.
