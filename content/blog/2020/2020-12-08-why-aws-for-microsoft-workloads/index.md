Microsoft&reg; workloads have long been the foundation of many enterprise businesses. However, with the advent of cloud
technology, many enterprise companies are starting to move away from the traditional IT operations these workloads run
on and migrate to the AWS&reg; Cloud for its efficiency, agility, and cost-effective nature.

While the cloud is an optimal solution for these companies, it can be a complex and intimidating decision to migrate off
legacy infrastructures. Thankfully, with over 700 Windows server-based offerings in the AWS marketplace, it’s clear that
AWS is a strong option for running Microsoft workloads.

### Cloud migration creates substantial savings

Running servers has never been cost-effective. The costs to buy, store, and maintain hardware for legacy systems, as well
as to hire the right experts to run these systems, have long been a necessary spend for enterprise businesses. That’s why
the cloud feels like a reprieve. 

Migrating applications to the cloud enables businesses to move away from their dependency on legacy systems while also
saving money.

With AWS, you pay only for the resources you use and can scale up and down based on need. This flexibility allows for
greater growth without risk or guesswork when calculating computing needs. Also, *bring your own licenses* (BYOL) policies
enable businesses to save money on existing investments when moving to AWS. According to 39% of survey respondents surveyed
by **IDG Research**, the cost savings associated with cloud adoption can be described as *substantial*. Furthermore, AWS
makes migration simple.

#### Easily deploy and manage Windows Server applications

In 2008, AWS launched Windows Server-based instances. As a Gold-certified member of the Microsoft Partner Network, AWS has
continuously worked to make [Windows workloads](https://onica.com/blog/microsoft-on-aws/why-aws-for-microsoft-workloads/)
available on the AWS Cloud. Microsoft and AWS have several mutual customers running Windows workloads on AWS today.

In many ways, AWS has worked to make Microsoft as native to the AWS cloud as possible. [AWS notes](https://aws.amazon.com/windows/faq/)
that customers have *successfully deployed every Microsoft application available on the AWS cloud*. AWS has succeeded in creating an
avenue for deploying all aspects of [Microsoft for business](https://onica.com/videos/grow-your-business-through-application-modernization/)
onto AWS. AWS runs IT applications, such as Microsoft SharePoint&reg; and Exchange&reg;, and also fully manages database services to run
SQL servers through Amazon RDS and Amazon EC2. For developers, AWS offers a flexible development platform with
[EC2 for Windows Server](https://onica.com/blog/onica-achieves-amazon-ec2-for-microsoft-windows-server-partner-status/) and easy deployment
and scaling with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which helps scale and
[deploy applications](https://onica.com/blog/running-windows-workloads-net-applications-aws-webinar/) built on .NET&reg;, Java&reg;, PHP&reg;,
node.js, Python&reg;, Ruby, and Docker&reg;.

#### Benefit from high reliability and strong security

The AWS infrastructure is global with 24 regions, 77 [availability zones](https://onica.com/blog/should-i-build-a-multi-region-architecture-in-aws/),
and 177 edge locations&mdash;numbers at the time of this post. AWS offers high availability across the world. Each AWS Region has multiple
Availability Zones and data centers, allowing for fault tolerance and low latency. This service, along with the 99.95% availability, enables
you to maintain mission-critical data, keeping your systems online and protecting you from catastrophic failure.

Similar to its infrastructure, AWS takes a multi-layer approach to security. End-to-end encryption, AWS Direct Connect, and Amazon Virtual
Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) all offer security for your applications. From dedicated connectivity to security groups and access control lists,
you can make to protect your information.

Whether you choose to take a hybrid cloud approach or dedicate your full enterprise operations to AWS, AWS offers a simplified approach
to [running Microsoft workloads](https://onica.com/services/application-modernization/) more cost-effectively.
