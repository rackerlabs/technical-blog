### Announcements

Rackspace Technology (NASDAQ: RXT), a leading end-to-end multicloud technology solutions
company, recently made the following announcements:

[VMware](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/29/2100794/0/en/Rackspace-Technology-Makes-Significant-Investment-in-Extending-its-VMware-Multicloud-Solutions.html):
Rackspace Technology is strengthening our strategic alliance with VMware by expanding our
managed services across VMware-based multicloud solutions.

[Dell](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/28/2100021/0/en/Rackspace-Technology-Expands-Options-to-Hybrid-Cloud.html):
We are working with Dell Technologies to create new modernized solutions for multicloud.
Rackspace Technology is expanding its Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware (RPCV)
portfolio with the Dell Technologies Cloud Platform (DTCP).

### Overview

Rackspace offers this solution as a direct result of validated customer demand and
observation of increasing government customer security requirements, both in the U.S. and
the U.K. The solution couples our tested and secured VMware platform design with a
comprehensive, managed, ITIL-aligned service wrap that meets the stringent security
requirements of government departments and public sector organizations. As a Dell Titanium
Partner and VMware Principal Partner, Rackspace Technology extends years of experience, a
wealth of expertise, and proven architecture so that customers receive optimal advantages
from these leading technologies. 

The solution provides you with a dedicated private cloud platform designed to meet current
security guidance from both the U.K. and U.S. national cybersecurity authorities. We host
your platform in secure cabinets within Rackspace Government data centers and support the
service with suitably security-cleared sovereign staff, experienced in the enhanced
controls necessary for supporting government customers. 

### Included services

When you choose Rackspace Government Cloud on VMware, you get the following
services, delivered by a team who truly understands the specific requirements of government
and public sector customers:

- Dedicated hardware and storage to provide peace of mind for data security
- 24/7/365 data center operations and system support providing a fully-managed private
  cloud solution up to, and including, a guest operating system
- Secure-by-design private cloud environment with proactive support, continuous monitoring,
  and governance
- Fully redundant solutions, with backup, restore, and disaster recovery built-in 
- Comprehensive system security services as standard, including enterprise-grade endpoint
  protection, file integrity monitoring, and host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
  and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- A unique combination of automation, accredited tooling, and human expertise, enabling
  governance and operations support
- Support for NHS Digital and National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and Cabinet Office
  accreditation audits in the U.K.
- Support for FedRAMP Authority to Operate (ATO) in the U.S.

### Additional security considerations

As part of the solution's fully managed service wrap, we operate, manage, monitor, and
control your environment's security components from the physical facilities to the host OS
and virtualization layer. 

Within the U.K., we provide this service through our Public Services Network (PSN)
service-provider-accredited, secure management platform, *RGC Central*. This walled-garden
environment ensures complete separation between your solution and the Rackspace corporate
network. The environment hosts stand-alone, accredited support tools with customers managed
as individual tenants within each tool. This approach ensures that we secure and separate
all sensitive customer data and that customers have support solutions that meet their own
security requirements.

Within the U.S., Rackspace Technology remains a leader in the FedRAMP authorization-enablement
space, powering 15 FedRAMP ATOs built on our managed service. We provide 24x7x365
hybrid-cloud management, operational support, and security services as a packaged,
on-demand, audited, and pay-as-you-go service. Rackspace Technology also handles approximately
80% of the operational and documentation burden of your environment's security and compliance
requirements to help you receive a FedRAMP ATO.

### Conclusion

As a result of these enhanced strategic alignments with VMware and Dell, Rackspace
Technology is expanding its portfolio with both RPCV and DTCP and bringing that innovation
to our government customers.
