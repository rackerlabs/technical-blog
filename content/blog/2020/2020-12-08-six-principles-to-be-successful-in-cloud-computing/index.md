What is [cloud computing](https://aws.amazon.com/) in simple terms?

<!--more-->

Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet *cloud* instead of on your computer’s hard drive
for faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. As cloud adoption continues to permeate businesses, cloud
computing is becoming the norm for many. But while cloud computing has many advantages over traditional IT computing, the nature
of the cloud creates new challenges.

### So, how are cloud computing services changing?

To learn what’s changed and master cloud computing, consider the following principles that help drive
[cloud computing success](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/):

#### 1. Infrastructure-as-Code

In the old days, if you needed a network cable plugged in, you would have to go to the data center to plug in the cable. Later,
when you needed to reconfigure the network, you had to go to the data center again. The cloud-equivalent of this? Clicking
buttons in the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). In this way, cloud computing services are changing our level
of efficiency.

With the power of the cloud, you can now codify your network design in code/configuration. And with both humans and machines
able to reason over this code, you can ensure consistent and reliable deployments, by using the same automation while you promote
infrastructure between development, staging, and production environments. (Want to learn more about *serverless* computing? Check
out our [video blog post](https://onica.com/blog/aws-serverless-application-development/).)

#### 2. Application focus

Cloud adoption works best as an application-focused program. Unlike the physical world, where large capital investments require
centralized planning, the cloud enables you to procure infrastructure on-demand, on an **application-by-application** basis.
This ability lets you make decisions in the context of what is best for each application, fine-tuned over time and scaled responsibly.
In this way, cloud computing is changing our ability to allocate funds more effectively. Want to learn more about cloud adoption? Check
out our [video blog post](https://onica.com/blog/cloud-adoption-framework-and-migration-strategies/).

#### 3. Automated pipelines

Applications, both home-grown and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), should take their place in cloud environments through a well-defined,
staged pipeline. These pipelines should start from the source and include all build, test, and deployment steps. Promotion between
environments happens automatically, sometimes with human-approval steps, and reliably. Want to learn more about creating a CI/CD pipeline?

#### 4. Stateless and immutable

Ideal cloud environments are stateless and immutable&mdash;allowing the rebuilding of the production environment without harming existing
environments and with nearly zero downtime. In practice, there are always some stateful components. However, in a
[well-architected cloud environment](https://onica.com/blog/are-you-well-architected-on-aws/), you can clearly identify, segregate, and
make these components resilient. The remainder of the environment embraces the ephemeral nature of the cloud and updates the deploy as
net-new infrastructure rather than in-place modifications. Are you well-architected in the cloud? Check out our
[blog post](https://onica.com/blog/are-you-well-architected-on-aws/).

#### 5. Deploy often

Many enterprise customers plan major projects around each deployment. Often happening once per month or once per quarter, these deployments
take long and detailed planning, sometimes taking entire weekends for the event. One of the primary goals of
[cloud adoption](https://onica.com/blog/security/how-to-be-successful-cloud-computing/) is to enable rapid deployments. To make this
possible, cloud environment designs should frequently deploy, with automated, reliable, and tested roll-back plans. Over time, as teams
gain confidence in the deployment automation, expect the frequency of deployments to increase and features, changes, and enhancements to
update more quickly, benefiting the business. Learn more in our [blog post](https://onica.com/blog/aws-devops-tools/) about leveraging
DevOps tools in AWS&reg;.

#### 6. Self reliance

The goal of centralized IT organizations should be to enable application teams to be self-sufficient. While IT teams deploy baseline
infrastructure, security policy, compliance tools, and automation standards, application teams should own the full lifecycle of their
application. From development to production, application teams are free to innovate, test, and deploy. Learn more in our
[blog post](https://onica.com/blog/aws-security-pillar-tools-best-practices/) about AWS security tools and best practices.
