So what does *Platinum* status actually mean? How does this fit into the future of our
company as it continues to grow? And what impact will this have on our clients?

In this post, I share my thoughts on what Platinum Status means for Rackspace Technology
as we continue to expand our offerings as a full-service Salesforce Implementation partner.

### What is Platinum status?

The Salesforce partner program is *best in class**, and Salesforce rankins implementation
partners in tiers, reserving Platinum status for very few partners. To be included in this
group of impressive companies is quite an honor. Salesforce assessed our annual contract
value (ACV) and ACV growth, certifications and specializations, customer satisfaction, and
customer stories to evaluate the company and designate it a platinum partner. In 2017, we
were the #1 ranked Regional SI partner based on ACV attribution.

Salesforce has supported us to help us achieve this significant milestone. We are thankful
for this partnership and intend to continue to work even harder at helping both our clients
and Salesforce be successful.

### Investing in our team to benefit our clients

Platinum status is an achievement to which all our team members contributed. Attaining
platinum status would not be possible without the incredible effort that each team member
shows for all of our clients. It is that passion that motivates us to help our clients
succeed. Each employee has contributed their time and effort to achieve industry-recognized
certifications and specializations, including Field Service Lightning, CPQ, and Marketing
Cloud.

As one benefit of being a Salesforce partner, we have access to unique training opportunities.
Working very closely with Salesforce, we’ve been able to leverage specialized training for
our employees, which helps them advance their individual careers and the mission of the
company as a whole.

Our company has welcomed team members with expertise in marketing cloud practices,
marketing automation, and digital marketing. With this expertise, our team is equipped to
support clients throughout the entire lead process.

Our clients are looking for one partner that can deliver across the entire process from
lead generation, through lead nurturing, all the way to building customer loyalty.

### A Bright Future for Rackspace Technology and our clients

We are thankful for all of our clients who allowed us to help them transform their
businesses. Achieving Platinum status shows it’s time for us to work even harder to bring
our full range of services to clients all around the country, delivering excellent value
to businesses.

Our clients are looking for one partner that can be their digital marketing agency, their
marketing automation specialist, and their Salesforce core technology partner. As a
full-service partner, we can now impact every aspect of our clients’ businesses&mdash;process,
technology, and creative. Rackspace Technology can support all of it, and we plan to continue
expanding our capabilities to provide value in all of those areas and beyond.

Platinum status is an achievement, but it’s not a reason to slow down. Rather, it’s an
occasion for us to take stock and double down on our focus on quality and excellence.
For us, Platinum status is just the beginning. It means we have to work even harder to
ensure our clients are delighted with the services we provide. We will continue to be
thought leaders and to develop our talent and skills across the business.
