On April 12, Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS) Premier Consulting Partner
**CorpInfo** presented "Deep Dive on Amazon Aurora" at *The Standard*
in New York City. The agenda included a technical presentation from
AWS Solutions Architect Puneet Agarwal, an Aurora case study featuring
CorpInfo customer GoGuardian&reg;, and a discussion on how to make
the business case for using Aurora in your organization.

After the presentation, attendees enjoyed a cocktail hour and networking
with their peers and AWS representatives. The event drew nearly 30
CTOs, SVPs, VPs, Presidents and Owners, IT Directors, and DBAs. Key
takeaways from our conversations with event attendees were that
Amazon Aurora is incredibly exciting and there is real interest around
organizations using it to solve their database challenges, including
the need for a fully managed database service that provides faster databases
with more core CPU power, instance sizes, and throughput. 

### Deep dive on Amazon Aurora

The AWS database migration service, with its schema conversion tool to
migrate intensive workloads, is very attractive for companies looking
to improve their operations by moving to the cloud. An added benefit of
the AWS database migration service is that the customer no longer has to
provision storage. This service has quickly become one of the most
effective AWS services available. CorpInfo has done a great
job compiling Amazon Aurora's highlights, which we have made
available to you in the following document:
[Amazon Aurora deep dive](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/corpinfowebsiteuploads/content/uploads/2016/04/14120846/Deep-Dive-on-Amazon-Aurora.pdf). 

Most relational databases were not designed for the cloud because they 
have various layers of functionality in a monolithic stack. When organizations
try to scale out these databases, they end up replicating the same
stack resulting in problems such as availability, cost, and lack 
of flexibility.

Amazon Aurora can solve your database challenges. Aurora is Amazonâ€™s highly
secure and fully managed MySQL-compatible relational database engine. The
platform provides users with high performance (5x) at a fraction of the cost
(1/10th) of a traditional MySQL database with the scalability and
availability benefits of hosting in the AWS Cloud.

### Why are organizations using Amazon Aurora?

The following list are just some of the benefits of using Amazon Aurora:

- Easy to use, and more efficient
- Highly available simplified storage management
- Predictable and faster failover with survivable caches and instant crash recovery
- Data security and monitoring capabilities
- Managed Service delivery
- Easy migration with no down-time
- Significant cost savings
