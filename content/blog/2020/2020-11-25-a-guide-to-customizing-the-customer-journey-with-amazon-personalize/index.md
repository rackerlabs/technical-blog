Customizing customer experiences based on browsing behavior, purchase history, demographics, 
psychographics, and other data can deliver more engaging experiences to customers, exposing them 
selectively to content and products that fall in their scope of interest. Not only does this 
increase the value the customer derives from their browsing experience, but it can also result in 
higher conversions, sales, and value generation for companies.

A plethora of different data sets and personalization characteristics help develop a 
comprehensive identity for customers that informs personalization algorithms. Developing a 
rich ML model with as many of these characteristics as possible can prove 
incredibly difficult. Amazon&reg; Personalize completely simplifies this process, allowing 
developers with no ML experience to use Amazon technology to enhance their 
eCommerce platforms.

#### Why do online platforms need personalization capabilities?

Personalization helps customers discover products and content that can meet their needs and 
interests. It motivates engagement on digital properties, as customers see more of what 
they want and like. Click-through-rates (CTR) is a metric that measures growth in 
engagement by using parameters such as watch durations on videos, dwell times on 
articles, and bounce rates. On top of all this, personalization improves conversion, 
resulting in growth in revenues or other desired outcomes.

The massive business potential observed in personalization motivates foresighted companies 
such as Amazon to invest and capitalize on the technology very early on. Amazon uses 
personalization intensively across their suite of platforms ranging from the Amazon.com 
website to Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Kindle, Amazon Music, and more. Today, the algorithms 
have become significantly advanced, seen in widgets that recommend destinations based on browsing history 
or categories of high interest to the customer.

#### Personalization challenges

A common approach to starting personalization is with a rule-based system designed 
with pre-existing ideas or trends in mind, such as a retailer recommending boots to women 
who visit their website from New York at the start of winter. This system makes sense, but 
it fails to capture the diversity of needs across people as user numbers and catalog 
sizes grow. Hence using ML should prove a better solution, producing a 
comprehensive algorithm more catered to individual-level recommendations. Working with 
ML, however, comes along with the following challenges:

+ Recommendation systems should respond to the actions and intentions of a user in real-time, 
and they should be able to effectively handle new users and new items in the catalog&mdash;a 
common challenge for ML systems. 
+ Recommendations should not have biases for popular goods, 
pushing the most relevant product or content based on the needs of the customer.
+ Algorithms are not one size fits all, requiring customizations for different use cases.
+ Building good personalization models is very hard, requiring a high level of ML expertise.

These complexities push people away from using ML so that they instead choose to go with rule-based systems or 
no personalization at all. Using a rule-based system might come with lesser complications, 
but they present poor performance, poor scalability, and a high cost and maintenance effort. 
Those who tackle ML tools for better results can also find them hard 
to build and manage. In addition, the tools can have limitations in matching recommendations
with customer intent and managing real-time personalization for new customers.

#### Reducing the barriers to entry&mdash;Amazon Personalize

Amazon Personalize provides a solution for individualization in the form of a fully-managed 
service for generating personalized recommendations. The service uses ML and deep-learning technologies 
to generate accurate and relevant recommendations. It also reduces the time it takes to get 
started from a typical period of six months or more to just a few weeks. It builds custom and 
private ML models by using your accumulated data, and best of all, it requires no ML expertise to use.

#### How it works

Amazon Personalize consists of three components:

+ **Amazon Personalize**: creates, manages, and deploys solution versions.
+ **Amazon Personalize events**: records user events for training data.
+ **Amazon Personalize Runtime**: gets recommendations from a campaign.

To make recommendations, Amazon Personalize uses an ML model trained with your 
data, which is stored in related datasets in a dataset group. Each model uses a recipe containing an 
algorithm for a specific use case. You deploy a solution version, the name for a trained model in Amazon Personalize, 
for use as a campaign, and people who use your applications receive recommendations based on 
the deployed solution version.

Data such as a userâ€™s activity stream on your platform, inventory metadata, and user metadata are 
input into Amazon Personalize, which then processes and outputs a customized personalization and 
recommendation API. Fully managed by AWS, Amazon Personalize inspects the data, identifies unique 
features, selects hyperparameters, trains and optimizes models, and performs a host of functions 
on the backend before you receive recommendations.

#### Setting up an Amazon Personalize workflow

The process of working with Amazon Personalize starts with creating related datasets and a data 
set group. You then input training data consisting of historical data and live-recorded event data
into the data set group. The next step is to create a solution version by using a recipe or AutoML and 
evaluate it using metrics. AutoML is the process of allowing Amazon Personalize to automatically 
choose the best recipe for your use case. Finally, the campaign deploys, and users 
on the platform begin receiving recommendations.

#### Preparing and importing data

To train models, Amazon Personalize uses data provided from source files (historical) or live 
recorded data such as activity on a website. To provide a source file to import data in 
Amazon Personalize, follow these recommendations:

+ **Format** in a comma-separated values **.CSV** file.
+ **Provide** a schema to guide Amazon Personalize to import the data correctly.
+ **Upload** the file into an Amazon S3 bucket that Amazon Personalize can access.

#### Datasets

Amazon Personalize recognizes three types of historical datasets. Each type has an associated 
schema with a name key that matches the value with the following dataset types:

+ **Users**: contains metadata about your users
+ **Items**: contains item metadata
+ **Interactions**: contains information of historical interaction data between users and items, 
metadata on browsing context, location, device, and so on.

**Note:** Only certain recipes use the **Users** and **Items** datasets, also known as metadata types.

#### Schemas

Before adding datasets to Amazon Personalize, you must define a schema for that dataset. 
Schemas in AWS feature the *Avro* format. There are precise guidelines for defining dataset 
schemas and sample resources to reference when creating each schema type in the AWS 
console. The following example shows a schema for User data:

For a more detailed look at specific versions of schemas for interactions or items, 
watch our [webinar](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16423/384879). 

#### User events

Amazon Personalize can use real-time user event data and process it individually or combine it 
with historical data to produce more accurate and relevant recommendations. Unlike historical data, 
Personalize uses newly recorded data automatically when getting recommendations. Minimum requirements for 
new user data are:

+ **One thousand records** of combined interaction data.
+ **Twenty-five unique users** with a minimum of two interactions per user.

#### Solutions ad recipes

+ **A solutions version** is a trained machine learning model that is ready to make recommendations to customers. 
+ **A recipe** is a trained model that uses historical and live data available in interactions 
datasets. Recipes consist of algorithms and data processing steps that optimize a solution for the type of 
developed recommendation. You can choose what recipe to use to train the model. If you choose AutoML, 
Amazon Personalize can automatically select appropriate recipes based on an analysis of training data.

#### Hyperparameters and hyperparameter optimization

Hyperparameters optimize training models before training begins. Different recipes use 
different hyperparameters, and it is essential to perform Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), or tuning, 
to ensure that you pick the right hyperparameter for a specific learning objective. Find optimal hyperparameters 
by running training jobs with different values from the available specified range. HPO is not 
a default Amazon Personalize process.

#### Evaluating a solution version and creating campaigns

Amazon Personalize generates a slew of metrics when creating solution versions, which allow you to evaluate 
the performance before creating campaigns and providing recommendations. You can compare the metrics between 
solutions that use the same training data and different recipes or solutions with modified hyperparameters 
to determine the best option. The solution versions producing the best results in metrics typically deploy 
as campaigns that are either created in the console or by calling the **CreateCampaign** API. After they deploy,
these campaigns can finally make recommendations.

#### Recommendations

Campaigns can produce two types of recommendations in Amazon Personalize:

+ **Real-Time recommendations** enrich individual user experiences. You can obtain 
these by calling the **GetRecommendations** API and supplying the user ID or item ID, depending on the recipe.

+ **Batch recommendations** help with large datasets that do not need real-time updates, such as 
getting product recommendations for all the users on an email list. Obtain these by calling the 
**CreateBatchInferenceJob** API.

Personalize returns both the preceding types of recommendation results as **.JSON** files to an S3 bucket.

#### Enriching customer experiences

By using the preceding steps, you can use Amazon Personalize to deliver high-quality recommendations to 
your customers for almost any product or content and adapt to their evolving needs and intents in real time. 
Training new models require just a few clicks, and you can deploy them with the specificity you want for 
recommendation algorithms.
