With this article I begin a series of hands-on developer oriented blog posts that
explore OpenStack orchestration using
[Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat).

To make the most of this article, I recommend that you have an OpenStack
installation where you can run the examples I present below. You can use our
[Rackspace Private Cloud](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/) distribution,
[DevStack](https://devstack.org/), or any other OpenStack distribution that
includes Heat.

### What is Heat?

**Heat** is the main project of the OpenStack orchestration program. It allows
users to describe deployments of complex cloud applications in text files called
*templates*. These templates are then parsed and executed by the Heat
engine.

Heat was born as the counterpart to the [CloudFormation](https://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html?r=7078)
service in AWS. It accepts AWS templates and provides a compatible API, but in recent OpenStack releases it has also began to grow outside of the shadow of CloudFormation, providing a nicer template syntax (the Heat Orchestration Template, or HOT) and new features not supported by its competitor.

### Installing the Heat client

As is common with all OpenStack services, low-level access to Heat is available
through a [REST API](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-orchestration-v1.html).
In most cases, however, working with a client is more convenient. There are two
official Heat clients; a stand-alone command line client and a web-based client
included with Horizon, the OpenStack dashboard project.

All the examples I present in this series of articles use the command line
client, which you have to install on your computer. I am not going to show how
to use the web-based client, but you should have no trouble figuring it out on
your own as it is very simple.

The following commands create a Python virtual environment and install the Heat
command line client in it, assuming you use `bash` or similar command prompt:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install python-heatclient

For those working on Windows, the commands are slightly different:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ venv\Scripts\activate
    (venv) $ pip install python-heatclient

Note that the above commands assume you have Python and `virtualenv` already
installed on your system.

To verify that `heat` was installed successfully, just run the client without
arguments to see its help message:

    (venv) $ heat
    usage: heat [--version] [-d] [-v] [-k] [--os-cacert <ca-certificate>]
                [--cert-file CERT_FILE] [--key-file KEY_FILE] [--ca-file CA_FILE]
                [--api-timeout API_TIMEOUT] [--os-username OS_USERNAME]
                [--os-password OS_PASSWORD] [--os-tenant-id OS_TENANT_ID]
                [--os-tenant-name OS_TENANT_NAME] [--os-auth-url OS_AUTH_URL]
                [--os-region-name OS_REGION_NAME] [--os-auth-token OS_AUTH_TOKEN]
                [--os-no-client-auth] [--heat-url HEAT_URL]
                [--heat-api-version HEAT_API_VERSION]
                [--os-service-type OS_SERVICE_TYPE]
                [--os-endpoint-type OS_ENDPOINT_TYPE] [--include-password]
                <subcommand> ...

Like the other OpenStack command line clients, the heat client needs to have
access to your account credentials, which you normally have in a `OPENRC` file.
For the examples in this article I assume that you have imported your `OPENRC`
credentials into the environment, so that there is no need to include credentials
as command line arguments.

### A basic Heat template

You are probably anxious to see how Heat works, so let's dive right into it.
Below you can see a very simple HOT template:

    heat_template_version: 2013-05-23

    description: Simple template to deploy a single compute instance

    resources:
      my_instance:
        type: OS::Nova::Server
        properties:
          image: cirros-0.3.3-x86_64
          flavor: m1.small
          key_name: my_key
          networks:
            - network: private-net

As you can see in the example, HOT templates are written as structured
[YAML](https://www.yaml.org/) text files. This particular example contains three
top-level sections:

- `heat_template_version` is a mandatory section that is used to specify the
version of the template syntax that is used. Most templates you are going to
see out there will have `2013-05-23` as version, the first release. There is
also a newer version labeled `2014-10-16` and introduced with the Juno release
that contains a few minor changes and additions.
- `description` is optional, and it is used to provide a description of what the
template does.
- `resources` is the most important section in a template, because this is where
the different components are defined. In this first example, the only resource
is called `my_instance`, and it is declared with type `OS::Nova::Server`, which
is the type of a Nova compute instance. The `properties` sub-section identifies
which image, flavor, public key and private network to use for the instance.

Are you ready to launch this template? Copy/paste the above text into your
favorite text editor, edit the image, flavor, key and private network names to
match your OpenStack installation, and save the file as `heat_1a.yaml`.

**Note**: If you are working with OpenStack Havana or Icehouse, then the private
network needs to be specified as an `id` instead of a name. You can find the
`id` of your network using the `nova net-list` or `neutron net-list` commands.
In the Juno release both the name and the `id` are supported.

Once you have the template on disk, you can use the following command to create
a *stack* from the template:

    (venv) $ heat stack-create my_first_stack -f heat_1a.yaml
    +--------+----------------+--------------------+----------------------+
    | id     | stack_name     | stack_status       | creation_time        |
    +--------+----------------+--------------------+----------------------+
    | ...    | my_first_stack | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | 2014-11-05T18:10:40Z |
    +--------+----------------+--------------------+----------------------+

Heat then starts a background job that instantiates the resources declared in
the template. In this case, that resource is just a compute instance. To query
the status of this job, use the following command:

    (venv) $ heat stack-show my_first_stack

The output shows all the information for this stack, including its status, which
will eventually be `CREATE_COMPLETE` (or `CREATE_FAILED` if there was an error).

### Template parameters and outputs

The template I presented in the previous section is extremely simple and not
very useful. It is actually not very convenient to have to edit the template to
match a particular OpenStack installation. Let's look at an improved version:

    heat_template_version: 2013-05-23

    description: Simple template to deploy a single compute instance

    parameters:
      image:
        type: string
        label: Image name or ID
        description: Image to be used for compute instance
        default: cirros-0.3.3-x86_64
      flavor:
        type: string
        label: Flavor
        description: Type of instance (flavor) to be used
        default: m1.small
      key:
        type: string
        label: Key name
        description: Name of key-pair to be used for compute instance
        default: my_key
      private_network:
        type: string
        label: Private network name or ID
        description: Network to attach instance to.
        default: private-net

    resources:
      my_instance:
        type: OS::Nova::Server
        properties:
          image: { get_param: image }
          flavor: { get_param: flavor }
          key_name: { get_param: key }
          networks:
            - network: { get_param: private_network }

    outputs:
      instance_ip:
        description: IP address of the instance
        value: { get_attr: [my_instance, first_address] }

This new version of the template adds two new top-level sections:

- `parameters` is used to declare a list of inputs that need to be provided by the user.
- `outputs` defines what attributes of the stack to export after it is deployed.

By using a `parameters` section, a template can be made generic. Each parameter
is given a name and a type and, optionally, a description and a default value.
The `get_param` function is then used to insert parameter values into resource
properties. Looking at the other side, the `get_attr` function is used in the
`outputs` section to extract desired attributes of the resources included in
the stack.

To try this new template, save it as file `heat_1b.yaml` and launch it as shown
before. Unless your system is identical to mine, you are probably going to get
an error, because the parameter defaults that I defined will likely not match
your OpenStack installation. However, since these settings are now parameters,
you can specify appropriate values for your environment in the `stack-create`
command without having to edit the template file. For example:

    (venv) $ heat stack-create second_stack -f heat_1b.yaml -P "key=my_key_name;image=Trusty"

In this example, the `key` parameter is set to `"my_key_name"` and the `image`
parameter is set to `"Trusty"`, so those values will be used for this
instantiation of the stack. For any parameters not included in the `-P` option,
the defaults are used, which applies to `flavor` and `private_network` in this
example. Note that parameters that do not have a default value defined must be
included in the `stack-create` command, so it is a good idea to define defaults
whenever possible.

Once the stack is created, the `stack-show` command includes the attributes
requested in the `outputs` section:

    (venv) $ heat stack-show second_stack
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | Property             | Value                                                 |
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | ...                  |                                                       |
    | ...                  |                                                       |
    | outputs              | [                                                     |
    |                      |   {                                                   |
    |                      |     "output_value": "10.10.10.72",                    |
    |                      |     "description": "IP address of the instance",      |
    |                      |     "output_key": "instance_ip"                       |
    |                      |   }                                                   |
    |                      | ]                                                     |
    | ...                  |                                                       |
    | ...                  |                                                       |
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

### Conclusion

In this article you saw how to create and launch simple Heat templates and how
to code these templates generically using parameters and outputs. But this is a
tiny portion of what you can do with Heat! Things start to get much more
interesting when you use it to deploy complex applications that include web
servers, databases, etc.

I hope this article served as a gentle introduction to Heat. There are two
important links that will help you expand your understanding of HOT templates
and complement what you have seen in this article:

- [HOT Template Specification](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/hot_spec.html): a formal description of the HOT template syntax.
- [OpenStack Resource Types](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/openstack.html): a detailed reference of all the supported resource types for HOT templates, including the properties and attributes that each provides.

In the next article in the series,
[OpenStack Orchestration in depth, Part 2: Single instance deployments](openstack-orchestration-in-depth-part-2-single-instance-deployments),
I'm going to show you the different ways in which you can deploy complex
applications, which is Heat's bread and butter. I hope to see you then!
