Rackspace just released a minor enhancement to Rackspace Application Services
for SAP to help our SAP&reg; on Microsoft&reg; Azure&reg; customers  migrate
to SAP S/4HANA.

According to Microsoft, SAP has announced that the deadline for all customers to
migrate to SAP S/4HANA is delayed from 2025 to 2027. However, the mutual support
contract with Oracle&reg;, IBM&reg;, and Microsoft will still be canceled in 2025.
So, any SAP business solution running on Oracle, DB2&reg;, and MSSQL must migrate
to SAP HANA by 2025, or theyâ€™ll lose support. As a result, approximately 10,000
customers need to migrate by 2025.

As customers modernize, an increasing number of SAP users plan to make the move
to public cloud on Azure. Rackspace Application Services for SAP helps companies
streamline operations, reduce costs, and mitigate risks during this migration.
Rackspace offers agile and cost-effective full-service solutions that deliver
proven expertise at scale in managing leading SAP applications on Microsoft Azure.

### What is SAP S/4HANA?

According to [SAP](https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html), "SAP S/4HANA
is an intelligent, integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that
runs on our in-memory database, SAP HANA."

SAP goes on to explain that the product provides intelligent automation,
follows proven best practice for professional services, enables you "to make
better decisions faster with embedded analytics, a conversational interface,
and digital assistants," and "enable new business models as your marketplace
evolves."

### Why migrate to SAP S/4HANA?

The International Data Corporation (IDC)
[surveyed 300 SAP customers in April 2019](https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/06/ea998aa5-557d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html)
and found that over half the respondents planned to migrate to SAP S/4HANA
within three years.

According to the report, when you migrate to SAP S/4HANA, you gain the following
benefits:

- Improved agility
- Reduced cost
- Optimized processes
- Encouraged innovation

### Migration concerns

As you prepare for migration to SAP S/4HANA on Azure, you need to keep in mind
the following areas of concern:

- Storage
- Redundancy, replication, and backups
- Resilience
- Scalability
- Monitoring
- Business continuity

Rackspace pledges to help you manage this migration smoothly, effectively, and
efficiently!
