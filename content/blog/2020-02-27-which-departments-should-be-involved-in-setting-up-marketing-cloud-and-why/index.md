It's easy to get wrapped up in the details and overlook the bigger picture when you’re implementing a new technology.
Especially when you're implementing a wide-reaching marketing automation platform like Salesforce
Marketing Cloud.

When you’re ready to implement Marketing Cloud, you need to identify which departments to involve in the
transition. You should also ensure that you have [well-developed processes in place](https://blog.rackspace.com/4-key-processes-need-capitalize-marketing-automation)
to get the most of your new marketing automation platform. This blog explains which departments you should involve
for a successful Marketing Cloud implementation.

### Marketing and sales

While your sales and marketing departments might operate independently and seem like two different operations,
they work towards a shared goal. They have [similar processes](https://blog.rackspace.com/marketing-automation-bridge-marketing-sales) that make marketing automation technology
useful to both teams. Involving these departments in the implementation process makes sense
because the platform directly affects them.

There is growing [evidence that automation is effective](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/08/marketing-automation-sales-or-marketing-tool.html)
at generating and nurturing leads for both marketing and sales departments. Automation increases the conversion rate of marketing response to qualified
marketing lead by 53%. It leads to a 9.3 percent higher sales quota achievement rate.
Marketing Cloud can also help each department with their daily workflows&mdash;from managing daily tasks and networking
to creating and maintaining clear and effective reports. Involving both departments in setting up Marketing Cloud lets them
give input about how to customize the software for their needs.

### Service

The team responsible for servicing your clients is uniquely positioned to help set up Marketing Cloud. Because this team
understands client needs, they can give insights into the features that are likely to serve
existing and potential clients best. Marketing Cloud also helps your service team analyze and track client preferences. You can then
create targeted campaigns based on this information.

Your service team can use their problem-solving experience to give immediate feedback about customizing
Marketing Cloud to serve clients better. For example, the service team might know that many clients have similar questions
after buying your product or service. By working together during implementation,
you can use automation to email clients with answers to those questions preemptively.

Your service team can also give you client feedback about the emails they’re receiving from your company. You can then use Marketing Cloud to
adjust your email strategy. This kind of information is valuable for implementing this technology to fit the way
the company intends to use it.

The service team is also a great asset for testing the [capabilities of your Marketing Cloud](https://blog.rackspace.com/similarities-differences-salesforce-marketing-cloud-pardot)
solution from a client's perspective. Set up a process for regularly checking in with these team members as you move through the implementation phase. Request that they review and test aspects
of your Marketing Cloud setup.

### Information Technology

Depending on the amount of data you want to bring into Marketing Cloud, the Information Technology department (IT) is often involved in implementation.
The IT department helps to ensure:

- Your MX records are set up so you can send from your domain.
- Password policies are consistent with your company’s policy.
- Your internal IP is whitelisted (preventing the continuous need for verification codes).

A strong partnership with your IT organization helps ensure you can leverage data for triggered sends, personalization, and segmentation.
It's important not to overlook how access to the right data can help you send hyper-personalized emails and work towards your goals.

### Leadership

Your leadership team plays a critical role in setting up any new technology like Marketing Cloud.
Gaps in leadership support impact effective communication and limit the success of your implementation.

Start by identifying one or two leaders within the company who can spearhead the implementation. These leaders are responsible for
communicating the implementation plan to all employees, providing updates throughout the setup process, and ensuring that everyone understands
the benefits of Marketing Cloud.

Engaging leadership during setup keeps your company aligned with its mandate and branding. Your leadership team can
see the bigger picture. They help the different departments work together to successfully implement Marketing Cloud in a way that can
drive transformative value for your business. Input from your leadership team helps to cement the efforts of your sales, marketing, and service teams.
