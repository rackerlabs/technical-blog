This post describes Oracle&reg; Application Express (APEX) and Oracle REST Data
Services (ORDS), including the steps to install APEX and install and configure
ORDS. Typically, database administrators (DBAs) carry out both of these tasks.

### APEX

Oracle developed APEX as a low-cost, web-based software development environment
platform that runs on an Oracle database. You can deploy APEX anywhere, which
enables developers to build secure and scalable enterprise apps with various
features.

### ORDS

ORDS, a Java-based application, enables developers with SQL and database skills
to develop REST APIs for Oracle Database. You can deploy ORDS on web and
application servers, including WebLogic&reg;, Tomcat&reg;, and Glassfish&reg;,
as shown in the following image:

### Install and configure

You can install and configure APEX and ORDS by using the following methods:

- Install APEX and ORDS and configure ORDS.
- Install APEX and configure a web listener: embedded PL/SQL gateway.
- Install APEX and configure the legacy web listener: Oracle HTTP Server.

For this post, I chose the first option, which Oracle recommends:  Install APEX
and ORDS and configure ORDS.

####  Install APEX

**Note:** You must install APEX on the database server node.

Install the Apex executable and create the tablespace and schema by using the
following steps:

1. Download and unzip the APEX software to **/u01/app/oradi/Apex**.

        $unzip apex_19.2_en.zip
        SQL> create tablespace apex_data datafile '+DMLCKI_DATA1/dmlcki/datafile/apex_data01.dbf' size 4000M; Tablespace created.
        $pwd /u01/app/oradi/Apex
        sqlplus "/as sysdba"
        SQL> @apexins.sql apex_data apex_data TEMP /i/
        apex_data - Tablespace to hold Apex Schema and its files
        TEMP - Temporary Tablespace
        /i/ - It is image directory

2· Change the administrator password.

        SQL> @apxchpwd.sql

3· Create the APEX\_LISTENER and APEX\_REST\_PUBLIC\_USER.

        SQL> @apex_rest_config.sql

#### Install and configure ORDS

Use the following steps to install and configure ORDS:

1. Download the latest release of ORDS to **/u01/app/oradi/ORDS**.

2. Unzip the downloaded file into the directory of your choice.

3. Copy the images directory, **/u01/app/oradi/Apex/apex/images**, from the
   APEX software zip file to the location where you plan to install ORDS.

        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 apex]$ cp -rp images /u01/app/oradi/ORDS/
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 apex]$ pwd
        /u01/app/oradi/Apex/apex
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 apex]$ cd /u01/app/oradi/ORDS/
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 ORDS]$ ls -lrt
        drwxr-xr-x 32 oradi oinstall  40960 Nov 6 14:21 images
        -rw-r--r-- 1 oradi oinstall 63211594 Nov 27 20:14 ords-19.2.0.199.1647.zip

4. Oracle recommends that you use the latest version of Java is for ORDS.
   Download JDK version 8 from the patch file, **p30437878_180231_LINUX.zip**,
   and unzip the file.

5. Take a backup of the existing **jdk** folder and copy **jdk1.8.0_231** to
   **ORACLE_HOME/**.

        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 clone]$ cd /u01/app/oradi/DMLCKI/db/tech_st/11.2.0/
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 11.2.0]$ mv jdk jdk_old
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 11.2.0]$ cd
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 ~]$ cd clone/
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 clone]$ cp -rp jdk1.8.0_231 $ORACLE_HOME/
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 clone]$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 11.2.0]$ mv jdk1.8.0_231 jdk
        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 11.2.0]$ java -version
        java version "1.8.0_231"
        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_231-b33)
        Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 25.231-b33, mixed mode)

6. Execute the following command to complete the setup and configuration:

        [oradi@diatmlckidb01 ORDS]$ java -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.server.Request.maxFormContentSize=3000000 -jar ords.war
        This Oracle REST Data Services instance has not yet been configured.
        Please complete the following prompts
        Enter the location to store configuration data: /u01/app/oradi/ORDS/params
        Enter the name of the database server [localhost]:diatmlckidb01.
        Enter the database listen port [1521]:1522
        Enter 1 to specify the database service name, or 2 to specify the database SID [1]:
        Enter the database service name:DMLCKI
        Enter the database password for ORDS_PUBLIC_USER:
        Confirm password:
        Requires to login with administrator privileges to verify Oracle REST Data Services schema.
        Enter the administrator username:sys
        Enter the database password for SYS AS SYSDBA:
        Confirm password:
        Retrieving information.
        Enter the default tablespace for ORDS_PUBLIC_USER [SYSAUX]:
        Enter **1** if you want to use PL/SQL Gateway or **2** to skip this step.
        If you are using Oracle Application Express or migrating from mod_plsql then you must enter **1**:
        Enter the database password for APEX_PUBLIC_USER:
        Confirm password:
        Enter **1** to specify passwords for Application Express RESTful Services database users (APEX_LISTENER, APEX_REST_PUBLIC_USER) or **2** to skip this step:
        Enter the database password for APEX_LISTENER:
        Confirm password:
        Enter the database password for APEX_REST_PUBLIC_USER:
        Confirm password:

You should be able to access the URL for APEX, **https://localhost:8080/apex/apex_admin**,
from your web browser.


### Conclusion

APEX, the Oracle tool for database and web application development, replaced the
legacy Oracle forms applications. Oracle APEX is a better choice because it
quickly builds applications at a low cost and enables DBAs to address the
requirements of your customers.

ORDS gives you direct access to your database access through a HTTP or HTTPS
request, so you can easily modify your data for an existing application. Software
developers just call a web service to interact with the database.
