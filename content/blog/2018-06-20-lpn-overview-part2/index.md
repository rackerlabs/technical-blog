In [Part 1](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/lpn-overview-part1/) of this
two-part series, we introduced License Plate Numbers (LPNs)
in the Oracle&reg; Warehouse Management System (WMS). In this follow-up post
we describe the various types of inventory transactions that you can
perform with LPNs.

### Performing inventory transactions with LPNs

You can use mobile devices to perform LPN inventory transactions in WMS. The
system enables you to pack LPNs with any grouping of material into a locator.
You can then enter the LPN to transact the material. The system transacts all
of the contents of the LPN, including the nested contents of a multi-level
LPN. You can associate LPNs with the following inventory transactions:

* Miscellaneous issues

* Subinventory transfers

* Direct inter-organization transfers

#### Perform a miscellaneous issue

You can perform a miscellaneous issue on an LPN that's on hand in the current
organization. To perform a miscellaneous issue for an LPN, use the following
steps:

1. Log in to PuTTy on the mobile device.

2. From the **Miscellaneous Issue** page, select **Responsibility > WHSE Mgmt > Warehousing > Inventory > Issues > Misc Issue**.

<ol start=3>
   <li>In the <b>Acct</b> field, enter the adjustment account for the issue and
   the corresponding receipt.</li>

   <li><p>In the <b>LPN</b> field, enter the LPN you want to transact.</p>

   <p><b>Note</b>: The LPN must be physically located at the current organization.</p></li>

   <li>Optionally, in the <b>Reason</b> field, you may enter a reason for the
   issue.</li>

   <li>Select <b>Done</b>.</li>
</ol>

#### Perform a subinventory LPN transfer

To perform a subinventory LPN transfer, use the following steps:

1. Log in to PuTTy on the mobile device.

2. From the **Sub Transfer** page, select **Responsibility > WHSE Mgmt >
   Warehousing > Inventory > Transfers > Sub Transfer**.

   ![Screenshot](picture2.png)

<ol start=3>
   <li>Enter the <b>LPN</b> you want to transfer from.</li>

   <li>In the <b>To Sub</b> field, enter the subinventory you want
   to transfer the LPN to.</li>

   <li>In the <b>To Loc</b> field, enter the destination locator for the
   LPN.</li>

   <li>Optionally, in the <b>Reason</b> field, you may enter a reason for the
   transfer.</li>

   <li>Select <b>Done</b>.</li>
</ol>

#### Perform a direct inter-organization transfer

You can also transfer LPNs to Oracle Warehouse Management-enabled
organizations. To perform a direct inter-organization LPN transfer, use the following steps:

1. Log in to PuTTy on the mobile device.

2. From the **Sub Transfer** page, select **Responsibility > WHSE Mgmt >
   Warehousing > Inventory > Transfers > Org Transfer**.

   ![Screenshot](picture3.png)

<ol start=3>
   <li>If necessary, enter the organization to transfer <b>from</b>.</li>

   <li>
      <p>
         Enter the organization to transfer <b>to</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Note</b>: You can only transfer LPNs to organizations that use
         Oracle Warehouse Management.
      </p>
   </li>

   <li>Enter the <b>Transaction Type</b>.</li>

   <li><p>Optionally, in the <b>LPN</b> field, enter the LPN that you want to
   transfer.</p>

   <p><b>Note</b>: If you don't enter an LPN, you must enter the <b>Item</b>,
   <b>Subinventory</b>, and <b>Locator</b> information.</p></li>

   <li>In the <b>To Sub</b> field, enter the destination subinventory.</li>

   <li>In the <b>To Loc</b> field, enter the destination locator.</li>

   <li>Select <b>Done</b>.</li>
</ol>

### Mobile PuTTy shortcuts

When using PuTTy on your mobile device, you can save time with the following
shortcuts:

| **Action**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | **Shortcut** |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Help                                  | F1           |

Oracle WMS by using a mobile interface. It explains various inventory
transactions that you can perform with LPNs. Thanks to LPNs, these
transactions process quickly. LPNs simplify management for organizations
with large warehouses.
