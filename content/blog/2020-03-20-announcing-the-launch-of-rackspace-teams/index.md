Rackspace Teams is a unique engagement model that we purposely developed based
on feedback from customers who asked for the ability to gain in-depth cloud
expertise on-demand without a long-term commitment to hire staff.

### Introduction

These customers want to combine the ability to dynamically change scope and
priorities typically provided when using internal teams with top-shelf expertise
in the following areas, to name a few:

- Amazon&reg; Web Services (AWS) cloud
- Infrastructure as Code
- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- DevOps transformation
- Containers

### Challenges

The traditional consulting model, based on hourly time and material engagements
with pre-defined deliverables and milestones, is too rigid. Dealing with change
can be costly, particularly if the change is frequent or ongoing. The traditional
managed services model focuses too much on monitoring and maintaining systems
and infrastructure or meeting incident and uptime SLAs and doesn't prioritize
optimizations and improvements.

### The Rackspace Teams solution

Rackspace Teams addresses those challenges by doing the following:

- Focus on a collaborative partnership with customers.
- Use disciplined agile project management methodologies.
- Build teams of highly skilled cloud engineers and architects with strong IT
  operations background. These skills are particularly handy when you need to
  build, migrate to, optimize, or maintain live production environments.

Rackspace provides the Teams service offering to customers who do not need
onsite access.

#### How it works

Customers generally start with Rackspace Teams when dealing with a migration to
AWS or when they need help to improve or optimize their AWS deployment. Customers
engage with a group of Rackers called a Pod.

A Pod consists of highly skilled senior and junior Rackers who proactively work
with customers to scope, define, and deliver "mini" cloud projects. Pod Rackers
use the Agile framework for software development and delivery. At the beginning
of each sprint, Pod Rackers curate a backlog of deliverables for the customer.
As a result of this grooming process, customers see real value delivered at the
end of each sprint.

An assigned engagement manager and Pod lead help the customer plan projects for
Pod rackers. Some projects that we have completed for our customers include
building out CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployments, implementing enhanced
monitoring, and cloud migrations.

#### Expertise

Rackspace Teams provides unbiased expertise. Pod Rackers work within your
environment using tooling and technology sets that already exist within your
internal IT organization. For example,  Customer A might use GitHub along with
CiricleCI&reg; for source control and CI/CD, whereas Customer B might use
bitbucket and Jenkins. Highly skilled Pod Rackers can help both customers by
adopting the tooling in place in each customer's environment. After helping many
customers in their journey to the cloud, we have developed expertise in various
cloud technologies such as Terraform and AWS. We share this expertise with our
customers when needed.

### Conclusion

Our collaborative *do with* approach of managing and maintaining a customer's
environment results in higher customer satisfaction. We are offering Rackspace
teams to AWS customers in North America, and we expect to expand this offering
to other major public clouds in other regions as well.
