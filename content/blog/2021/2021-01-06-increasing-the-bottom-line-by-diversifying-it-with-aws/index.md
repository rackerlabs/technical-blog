Why should you move your IT infrastructure into Amazon Web Services (AWS)&reg;, and what are the benefits of AWS? 

<!--more-->

### How can AWS help you diversify your IT to increase your bottom line?

Cloud computing provides IT infrastructure capabilities to organizations, liberating them from devoting people and
resources to activities that don’t directly contribute to their bottom line.

This allows companies to focus on the core competency of their business instead of devoting time, people, and money
to IT-related projects. When using a cloud infrastructure, users can access their data anytime and anywhere on the
web, without the limitations of a physical data center. Thus giving them the ability to scale IT needs up and down
with demand easily, for computing, data storage, or database services, and keep IT investment and operations lean
and agile.

#### Use cases for AWS solutions

Looking to increase the load speed of your website? Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets store and retrieve any
amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web. Are you running an e-commerce website with thousands of images to
load? Using S3 buckets to store your images and videos can cut load time in half! Is your website available worldwide?
[CloudFront&reg;](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/cloudfront/), Amazon’s global content delivery network, delivers
content from local servers, decreasing load time even further.

Do you need unlimited compute power for building and running applications? Or are you a growing manufacturing company
looking to implement one of the SAP&reg; software solutions to manage your enterprise resources? Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable virtual compute space-saving organizations hundreds of thousands of dollars&mdash;from
installing and configuring their servers to run data-heavy enterprise applications. It also provides the flexibility to scale
up compute power easily as your business grows.
