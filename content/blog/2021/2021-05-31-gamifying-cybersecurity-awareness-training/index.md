Cybersecurity, at its very core, is a competition. On one side, we have
defenders trying to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
their digital assets. On the other side, we have attackers with differing motives
vying to control the same digital assets.

### The way it often is&mdash;scripted

This adversarial cybersecurity narrative is rife with the kind of conflict and
tension that makes for a thrilling movie, video game, or television plotline.
Unfortunately, traditional cybersecurity awareness training rarely delivers the
same level of excitement that we find in more dramatic and entertaining depictions
of cybersecurity. For the most part, awareness training still relies on rote
learning. The conversation is too often one-sided and incentivizes learners to
spend as little time as possible with their training materials. Instead of
educating and empowering employees to be cybersecurity superheroes all year long,
cybersecurity awareness training becomes a quickly forgotten nonevent.

### The way it could be&mdash;gamified

So how do we close the engagement gap? Can we make cybersecurity awareness
training more appealing? The answer is an unequivocal **yes**. To do so, we need
to recover some of the intensity lost when moving the cybersecurity conversation
from complex, real-world adversarial competition to the more theoretical business
education environment. We need to create a more meaningful and immersive learning
experience. What we need is gamification.

Gamification, as defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is "the process of
adding games or gamelike elements to something (such as a task) so as to
encourage participation." A
[popular taxonomy of gamification elements for education](https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-019-0106-1)
has the following five categories that we can apply to cybersecurity awareness
training:

#### #1 Performance

*Performance elements provide feedback to learners, help learners understand
where they are on their educational journey, and encourage progression.*

A practical example that leverages many performance elements is the venerable
Capture the Flag (CTF) contest. If you've never participated in a CTF contest,
don't worry&mdash;they are relatively easy to understand. Players find a flag
(a piece of not-easily guessed information) by solving a puzzle or doing a cyber
scavenger hunt. They submit the flag to the submission system, which gives
players or teams points based on how difficult the flag was to find and how
quickly the team captured it. A scoreboard keeps track of point totals and
typically includes a colorful graph showing points over time.  

CTFs are underutilized as training tools because many people are not aware of
how easy it is to separate the content from the format. We can create a CTF
focused on cybersecurity policy and best practices as easily as one about
exploiting web application vulnerabilities. Keeping score, varying problem
difficulty degree, showing progress over time&mdash;all these elements can
combine to turn the most mundane subject into an engaging game.

Acknowledging participation and rewarding winners is also an important part of
what makes CTFs fun. In 2021, e-gift cards and non-fungible tokens, or NFT-based
badges, or rewards are the way to go.

#### #2 Fictional

*Fictional elements help learners focus on content and more easily remember
complex ideas.*

Unfortunately, the scenarios in traditional cybersecurity awareness training are
often disjointed. We hop from one group of new characters to another without a
transition. We usually aren't provided with much of a backstory, and there is
little character development.

A good alternative is to leverage popular fictional characters and storylines.
Staying with the same story and characters throughout a training course can also
be very helpful. A consistent, well-known storyline is easier to build on and
allows for the rapid introduction of more complex ideas without wasting time on
unnecessary exposition.

#### #3 Personal

*Personal elements help learners by providing meaning.*

As mentioned earlier, one of the failings of traditional cybersecurity awareness
training is that it is a one-sided conversation where the same information is
imprinted on learners over time by using rote learning. The only tasks that ask
for learner participation are typically multiple-choice quizzes.

Instead, we should encourage more active learner participation. We can do this
by ensuring content is up-to-date and relevant. Introduce novel ideas, scenarios,
and technology. Leverage puzzles, scavenger hunts, and other fun cognitive tasks
where you can. If possible, try to engage more of the learner's senses: Think
virtual or augmented reality, music, food, and so on.

#### #4 Social

*Social elements help keep learners from feeling isolated.*

Having learners belong to a team as part of their training encourages cooperation
between individuals. Competition between individuals or groups encourages
awareness of others and helps learners stay focused on their goals.

#### #5 Ecological

*Ecological elements help create an exciting learning environment.*

Whatever puzzles or games you employ, consider adding a bit of randomness or
chance. Easter eggs, bonuses, and random or variable point scores can keep
outcomes unpredictable.

Adding a time constraint to challenges helps by creating a sense of urgency.

### Implementing gamification

Gamifying cybersecurity awareness doesn't happen overnight. Introduce different
aspects over time and tailor them to what works best for your company. Make sure
to survey participants after each training event. Most importantly, have fun. If
you aren't having fun putting together your cybersecurity awareness training,
then your employees will not have fun receiving this training.

### How can Rackspace help me gamify my cybersecurity training?

Cybersecurity training loves the cloud. It's easy to create fully automated,
isolated, and ephemeral learning environments. Whether you are looking to host a
single instance CTF dashboard, leverage Kubernetes to host web-based puzzles, or
provision 1000 virtual desktops, Rackspace has over 3,000 certified cloud
professionals who can help you automate and manage your infrastructure so you
can focus on making engaging content.
