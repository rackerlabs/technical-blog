Replace with short intro sentence or two.

When most people think of CRM systems (if they think about them), they envision
tools used by salespeople to record information about customers and deals.
While these are important things for any business to track, more and more
organizations are realizing the value of a central platform for managing all of
their customer interactions, including their marketing, sales, contact syncing,
and operational processes. These organizations use their CRM platform to
identify and contact prospective new customers, manage sales to new and existing
customers, deliver their goods and/or services, and ensure proper billing.

Having one platform to manage customers throughout this entire lifecycle enables
organizations to share information across departments that are often
disconnected. As a result, these organizations are able to more effectively
design, track, measure, and analyze all of their customer interactions and
outcomes. They are able to leverage these analytics and insights in many new
ways such as driving decisions, formulating new business strategies, and
developing product/service ideas.

Our nonprofit customers are leveraging Salesforce as a central platform for
managing their organization, even though they do not “sell” in the traditional
sense. These organizations have multiple sources of revenue – donations from
individuals and companies, grants from foundations and governments, earned
income from programs, and investments and outsourced services. The nonprofits
need effective tools to manage relationships, communications, opportunities, and
issues across their different types of customers. These same principles apply to
most organizations – whether for-profit or not-for-profit.
