Traditionally, people saw technology roles as pockets of excellence that enabled an IT company to make the most of its
resources. However, this idea is changing, given the dynamic business environment and intense competition that prevails
in today’s globalized world.

### What can a DevOps culture do for your business? 

Developers like to innovate and come up with new ways to make a system more efficient, while the operations
team might oppose any change that undermines stability and reliability. Such conflicts eventually negatively impact the
performance of a software product and bring about much frustration to everyone involved.

[DevOps](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/devops/) (development and operations) is an enterprise software development
phrase used to mean a type of agile relationship between development and IT operations. The goal of DevOps is to change
and improve the relationship by advocating better communication and collaboration between the two business units to establish
a DevOps culture.

### What is DevOps?

To overcome such conflicts, the culture or concept called DevOps is evolving. As the name suggests, it is a close
collaboration between the development and operation teams to work towards the common goal of improving the quality of
every product and eventually increasing revenue for the organization.

In other words, DevOps is a set of tools and best practices that integrates the processes of development, deployment, and
operation to tap into the many advantages that come with such collaboration. It represents a new mindset or DevOps culture
where everyone comes together to improve the products and services they offer through better communication, understanding,
and collaboration.

In this sense, a DevOps team is a cross-functional team consisting of developers, QAs, business analysts, operation
engineers, business managers, and more who collaborate to reduce conflicts and improve efficiency.

### What can DevOps do for your business?

The goal of every company is to generate profits through products and services that exceed the expectations of their
customers. A DevOps culture creates the right culture and mindset to meet this goal. Here are some of the advantages
DevOps provides for your business:

#### Faster deployment

Typically, companies that incorporate DevOps deploy code 30 times faster and have less than 50 percent failures
compared to companies that don’t implement DevOps, according to a [survey](https://puppet.com/resources/report/2016-state-devops-report/)
by Puppet Labs&reg;.

#### Faster time-to-market

DevOps helps you go from an idea to working software within a short time, and in turn, this helps you gain a competitive
advantage in the industry.

#### Continuous software delivery

Companies with a DevOps culture enhance the process of continuous incremental improvements to give you a greater degree of
flexibility to try new features.

#### Stability and innovation

Traditionally, development teams possess an innovative ability to bring in new features, while the operations team is
responsible for a product’s stability. Unfortunately, these opposing parameters cause much conflict in performance
measurement.

Because a DevOps culture brings these different teams together, your company gets the best of both stability and
innovation. At the same time, the performance metrics are more standardized, thereby making it easier to evaluate the
performance of different teams.

#### Less complex problems

DevOps encourages different groups to share a code base, perform continuous integration, and automate deployments, among
other things. As a result, you can detect problems within software or infrastructure at a much earlier stage, so they tend
to be less complex. Also, resolution time is faster because of improved communication and reduced dependence.

#### More time for innovation

Automated deployments, a key aspect of DevOps, make deployments more predictable and easier. At the same time, this automation
takes away much of the routine and repetitive tasks from employees to give them more time and space for innovation.

#### A DevOps culture eliminates departmentalization problems

A cross-functional team that communicates that collaborates eliminates departmentalization problems such as a single point
of error and work redundancy.

#### Reduced cost

DevOps reduces costs significantly because fixing errors takes less time. Improved communication and shorter development
cycles also help bring down the cost of resources.

#### More flexibility

DevOps gives your organization the flexibility to tap into the power of emerging technologies like cloud computing because
much of the deployment is automated, and the architecture tends to comprise of loosely coupled components.

### Conclusion

In short, DevOps represents a cultural shift in the way different IT teams collaborate and work together. It is a practice
where developers understand infrastructure and operations engineers understand code, and both learn all the parts as a whole.
Such a change in mindset reverberates across the entire organization and creates a positive environment that greatly increases
productivity and efficiency, not to mention the increased revenue.

DevOps is undoubtedly revolutionizing the IT industry by improving performance, reducing costs, encouraging innovation,
reducing failures, and, through it all, offering immense benefits for every business.
