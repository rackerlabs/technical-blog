Rackspace is proud to announce the general availability of Rackspace Government
Cloud (RGC) on Amazon&reg; Web Services (AWS).

Rackspace offers this solution as a direct result of both validated customer
demand and observation of changing technology dynamics. RGC on AWS brings an
already best-in-class managed security and compliance platform to the public
cloud, which enables state-of-the-art private, public and hybrid cloud solutions
for the government ecosystem. System integrators (SIs) and independent software
vendors (ISVs) that leverage our platform can significantly shorten the time and
cost required to achieve Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
Authorization to Operate (ATO).

When you combine RGC and
[Rackspace Inheritable Security Controls (RISC)]( https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/newsroom/rackspace-and-telos-team-up-to-accelerate-the-fedramp-journey),
you can look forward to a streamlined path to FedRAMP ATO in as little as four
months. That’s three times faster than average and offers as much as a 70%
reduction in the total cost of ownership compared to doing it yourself or hiring
hourly consultants. You gain access to our economies of expertise, including
more than 5,000 certified cloud subject matter experts on staff who are
well-equipped to handle the biggest and most complex projects. When you choose
Rackspace and RISC you get the following benefits delivered by a team who
specializes in FedRAMP authorization enablement:

-	FedRAMP workshop
-	FedRAMP gap assessment
-	FedRAMP marketplace listing
-	FedRAMP compliance as a service
-	FedRAMP documentation
-	System security plan
-	Body of evidence automation
-	FedRAMP audit support
-	Fully managed cloud services within a FedRAMP-authorized cloud service provider
-	Secure cloud environment with continuous monitoring and governance
-	Fully redundant solutions, with business continuity and disaster recovery options
-	24/7/365 operations, staffed by U.S. personnel
-	A unique combination of automation, tooling, and human expertise, enabling governance and operations support

We operate, manage, monitor, and control the security components of your
environment from the physical facilities to the host OS and virtualization layer.
We also handle approximately 80% of the operational and documentation burden of
the security and compliance requirements within the environment to help you
receive a FedRAMP ATO.

Rackspace remains a leader in the FedRAMP authorization enablement space,
powering 13 FedRAMP ATOs built on the Rackspace managed service, and provides
24x7x365 hybrid-cloud management, operational support, and security services as
a packaged, on-demand, audited, and pay-as-you-go service.
