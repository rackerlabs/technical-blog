Keystone and many current OpenStack API components run in an [Eventlet](https://eventlet.net/) based http server.  Eventlet is designed to perform well in networked environments and handles everything in a single thread.

The developers responsible for the Keystone project have recently recommended using Apache (with the mod_wsgi module) as a front-end rather than the traditional “Keystone” Eventlet-based process.

By using Apache as the front-end for Keystone, one gains better performance due to Apache’s ability to do multithreading.  One can also take advantage of the variety of http server modules currently available for Apache.  One popular module, [Shibboleth](https://shibboleth.net), provides the ability to use one set of credentials to authenticate against multiple OpenStack clouds (more info [here](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/configure_federation.html)).

Here is a straight forward guide on how to setup Keystone to utilize Apache in your existing OpenStack deployment.


<!--more-->

Stop Keystone Service (It is not necessary to run this service with this config)

    sudo service keystone stop

Install Apache

    sudo apt-get install -y apache2

Install Python WSGI module for Apache

    sudo apt-get install -y libapache2-mod-wsgi

Make cgi-bin directory for Keystone

    sudo mkdir -p /var/www/cgi-bin/keystone/

Create Python script for Apache (admin and main)

    ( cat | sudo tee /var/www/cgi-bin/keystone/admin /var/www/cgi-bin/keystone/main ) <<EOF
    import logging
    import os

    from paste import deploy

    from keystone.openstack.common import gettextutils
    # NOTE(dstanek): gettextutils.enable_lazy() must be called before
    # gettextutils._() is called to ensure it has the desired lazy #lookup behavior. This includes cases, like keystone.exceptions, #where gettextutils._() is called at import time.
    gettextutils.enable_lazy()

    from keystone.common import dependency
    from keystone.common import environment
    from keystone.common import sql
    from keystone import config
    from keystone.openstack.common import log
    from keystone import service


    CONF = config.CONF

    config.configure()
    sql.initialize()
    config.set_default_for_default_log_levels()

    CONF(project='keystone')
    config.setup_logging()

    environment.use_stdlib()
    name = os.path.basename(__file__)

    if CONF.debug:
        CONF.log_opt_values(log.getLogger(CONF.prog), logging.DEBUG)


    drivers = service.load_backends()

    # NOTE(ldbragst): 'application' is required in this context by WSGI spec.
    # The following is a reference to Python Paste Deploy documentation
    # https://pythonpaste.org/deploy/
    application = deploy.loadapp('config:%s' % config.find_paste_config(),
                             name=name)

    dependency.resolve_future_dependencies()
    EOF

Configure Apache to listen on ports 35357(admin) and 5000(main)

    ( cat | sudo tee /etc/apache2/ports.conf ) <<EOF
    Listen 35357
    Listen 5000
    EOF

Configure Keystone Virtual Hosts

    ( cat | sudo tee /etc/apache2/sites-available/keystone-httpd.conf ) <<EOF
    WSGIDaemonProcess keystone user=keystone group=nogroup processes=3 threads=10

    <VirtualHost *:5000>

        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/cgi-bin/keystone/admin
        WSGIProcessGroup keystone
    </VirtualHost>
    EOF

Enable Keystone site

    sudo a2ensite keystone-httpd

Reload Apache

    sudo service apache2 reload
