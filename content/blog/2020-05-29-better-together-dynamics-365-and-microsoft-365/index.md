We are happy to announce we have expanded our services to include Dynamics 365
Business Central, as well as the Dynamics 365 services and marketing applications.

Why is this such an exciting announcement? Not only is it easier for our customers
to have one partner they can work with across their Microsoft needs (Microsoft 365&reg;,
Azure&reg;, and Dynamics 365) but also because the Microsoft platform offers such
power. Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 have seamless integration capabilities to
increase data visibility, gain efficiencies, and improve customer experiences.
Furthermore, by adding benefits through the Power Platform, such as Power Automate
and Power BI, you can streamline business processes and enhance reporting capabilities.

### Connect your business

With Microsoft 365 together with Dynamics 365, you connect with your business
in the following ways:

- **Unified interface**: Work where your business takes you with a powerful mobile
application for either your mobile or your tablet device. Also, use Azure Active
Directory (Azure AD) to navigate seamlessly between your Microsoft 365 and
Dynamics 365 applications.

- **Boost productivity**: Create leads, schedule tasks, process sales orders,
and access live data from Dynamics 365 without leaving Microsoft Outlook&reg;.
Also, Microsoft Excel&reg; can be used to access and update live Dynamics 365
data such as customers, sales order, and purchase orders while limiting access
by using Azure AD and Dynamics 365 security.

- **Automate business processes**: With the Power Automate low-code capabilities,
you can create workflows to streamline business processes, reducing delays and
increasing data accuracy. Power Automate can integrate with tools like Microsoft
Teams&reg; so an approval can start in Dynamics 365, but the notification can be
sent to Teams.

- **Work smarter**: Real-time data updates help users spot trends, prevent issues,
and deliver exceptional customer experiences. Sales representatives can gain a
holistic view of their customers, and warehouse managers can gain deeper insights
into their inventory.

### Professional services

Rackspace has developed partnerships to provide professional services for the
following Dynamics 365 applications: Business Central, Sales, Customer Service,
Field Service, and Marketing.

We provide the following services:

- **Advise**: Rackspace works with you to understand your business requirements
and advise you on your solution options.

- **Design**: After deciding on the Dynamics 365 application for your business
requirements, we design the solution and then review it with you.

- **Build**: After you review the solution design, the Dynamics 365 consultants
build the environment. During this time, we configure and test the environment.
The team provides training, and end-users test the design and configuration. Once
finalized, the solution consultants support the conversion from the test
environment to production.

- **Optimize**: As you are operational with your Dynamics 365 application, we
can continue to offer services and support to enhance your offerings.
