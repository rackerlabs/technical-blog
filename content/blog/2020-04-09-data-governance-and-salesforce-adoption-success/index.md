Data is a business's intellectual property. Whether your company is pursuing
Salesforce&reg; implementation or is actively using Salesforce, you must have
clean and accurate data.

Having bad data can lead to failed implementations or costly resources to fix
bad data. When you don't have the right information, you can end up with
duplicate accounts, inaccurate reports, an absence of internal
synergies, and a lack of user adoption.

However, specific data management strategies and best practices can help your
business avoid bad data situations or improve your current system. Clean data
is critical to successful user adoption and overall Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) success. Without proper structure, processes, and security
roles and profiles in place, then *anyone* from your team can add or
manage information in Salesforce. They might use a variety of
inconsistent methods.

### Duplicate accounts cause problems

In multiple Salesforce instances, we have seen duplicate accounts due to a lack
of data governance processes. This duplication is problematic when, for example,
your sales team updates one of the accounts, and an account manager references
the duplicate account. The manager does not have access to the most current
information, and the contact can receive calls from two different people with
conflicting messages. You can avoid this by creating standard processes and by
using the following duplicate management apps:

- **Salesforce**: Has deduplication functionality (already available in Salesforce).
- **DemandTools**: Discovers, cleanses, and maintains data quality.
- **Ringlead Unique Upload**: Imports duplicate-free lists to complement existing
  tools.
- **Cloudingo**: Identifies and removes duplicates by using a dashboard-based tool.
- **Cloudingo Studio**: As a developer-focused tool, supports complex Salesforce
  Object Query Language (SOQL) use.

### Additional steps

But using a tool one time is not enough&mdash;establishing a process is critical.
To do this, you should standardize your processes, assign appropriate security
profiles and roles, and de-dupe your data. Then properly train your team so that
they follow the process. Standardizing includes setting rules on
abbreviations, such as US, U.S, or USA. De-duping includes identifying, matching,
and merging duplicate accounts, such as J.Doe and John Doe. If the accounts are
the same, merge them. After you do this front-end clean up and have these
processes in place, train all current employees and new employees. Pay attention
to new features and Salesforce updates and schedule training for updated
processes.

Then, after you establish the processes and set the standard, you *must maintain
quality data*. To do this, monitor your data. Look at dashboards and
reports to gain insight and create visibility across the enterprise. This
oversight allows you to maintain data quality. Use Salesforce to implement
controls and set your business up for success with clean data.

### We can help

We can create system architecture based on your business process and create the
standards and processes to enable clean data from the start. We can also help
current Salesforce customers with data cleansing and provide managed services
to assist with data policy, data governance, training, and adoption.
