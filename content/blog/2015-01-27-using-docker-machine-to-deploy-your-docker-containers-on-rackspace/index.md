## Background
Docker announced [Docker Machine](https://blog.docker.com/2014/12/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/) in December 2014. This clever new software eliminates the need to create virtual machines and install Docker before starting Docker containers on them. It handles the provisioning and install process for you behind the scenes. You can learn more about Docker Machines at its [GitHub project page](https://github.com/docker/machine).

Let's take a quick look at how we can get some of this awesomeness!

### Install

Docker Machine has not yet been released, which means you have to download the `docker-machine` binary from [https://github.com/docker/machine/releases](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases). There aren't any dependencies to install, so you can just rename it to `docker-machine` and place it into your path somewhere.


### Credentials

Unsurprisingly, you'll also need your API-key and Rackspace username. If you're unsure about how or where to get those, please follow [these instructions](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/view-and-reset-your-api-key/).


### Create your first Docker Host

We can now user `docker-machine` to create our Docker host:


      docker-machine create --driver rackspace \
                            --rackspace-api-key $YOUR_API_KEY \
                            --rackspace-username $YOUR_USERNAME \
                            --rackspace-region DFW my-first-docker-machine-host

This step will take a few minutes. If you want to streamline your command further, you can export your credentials and region in the environment variables `OS_USERNAME`, `OS_API_KEY` and `OS_REGION_NAME`. This reduces the command to:


    docker-machine create --driver rackspace my-second-docker-machine-host

In either case, you should see something along the lines of:


    INFO[0001] Creating server...                            Name=my-second-docker-machine-host
    INFO[0070] "my-second-docker-machine-host" has been created and is now the active machine
    INFO[0070] To connect: docker $(machine config my-second-docker-machine-host) ps


### Some other basic operations

We can also perform some other basic management tasks:


    # show the active "machine" (the default one)
    docker-machine active

    # displaying a complete list of details
    docker-machine inspect my-first-docker-machine-host

    # display the docker-client connection details for a machine
    docker-machine config my-first-docker-machine

    # removing a machine
    docker-machine rm my-first-docker-machine-host

More information can be [found here](https://github.com/docker/machine#rackspace).


### Lets actually put this to work

Lastly, we simply use the `docker` command and extract the matching config via the `docker-machine` command:


    docker `docker-machine config my-second-docker-machine-host` run --name my-redis-container -d redis

We can then run the `ps` command to check on our container:

    docker `docker-machine config my-second-docker-machine-host` ps

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    3cff35053aee        redis:latest        /entrypoint.sh redi   35 minutes ago      Up 5 minutes       6379/tcp            my-redis-container

We confirm that Redis is indeed running and accepting connections. In order to do so, we spin up a mini container, drop to the console, and use telnet to see if Redis `PINGs`:

    docker `docker-machine config my-second-docker-machine-host` run --link my-redis-container:redis -it --rm busybox

    / >>> telnet redis 6379
    PING
    +PONG
