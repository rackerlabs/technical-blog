If you’re using marketing automation only to send out an email newsletter now
and then, you’re missing out on powerful opportunities to engage your customers
at every step along the path from lead to loyalty.

You might feel overwhelmed by the number and variety of options your marketing
automation platform offers. From qualifying and nurturing your leads to
organizing and maintaining your data, it’s hard to know where to start and all
too tempting to stick with what you know.

Read on to learn key tasks marketing automation helps with, so you can
maximize your investment in this platform and boost your marketing efforts. If
you aren’t doing the following things, it’s time to start.

### Score and qualify your leads

With a platform that captures high-quality information about your leads, you
can better serve individuals at each stage of the sales cycle by using that
information to score and qualify their interest in your products and services.
Lead scoring allows your marketing and sales teams to evaluate your leads with
more nuance. That means leads aren’t treated as though they’re all equally
interested, or positioned to be interested, in your product or
service&mdash;after all, they’re not.

Marketing automation enables you to score your leads based on their demographics,
purchasing behaviors, and actions with your business. Many platforms use a *cold*
to *warm* scale, while others assign a numerical value from low to high or a
letter grade from *F* to *A*.

You can score leads based on personas that your marketing team has already
created or use
[progressive profiling](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_forms_progressive_profiling_setup.htm&type=5),
which is available in platforms such as Pardot&erg; and Hubspot&reg;. Progressive
profiling displays a range of form fields based on the information that a lead
has provided. Different fields are shown on each subsequent form that particular
lead filled out, enabling you to build out a fuller profile of the person. The
more information you collect on each lead, the better positioned you are to
help nurture them through the sales funnel.

Your marketing team should work with sales to outline what actions and behaviors
are important for qualifying leads and how to define a Marketing Qualified Lead
(MQL) and a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL). This enables you to set up a process
within your marketing automation platform for passing MQLs to the sales team to
qualify when leads reach an agreed-upon threshold.

### Conduct a drip campaign

Rob Phillips, CRM Engineer at Pardot, calls drip campaigns invaluable due to
their ability to tie together marketing and sales efforts. Using your marketing
automation for drip campaigns can lead to
[20% more sales opportunities](https://www.brafton.com/blog/email-marketing/email-drip-campaigns-explained/).

A drip campaign is an automated series of emails sent to your leads. Depending
on the actions each recipient takes, the system triggers a particular email or
action to provide them with the information that is most relevant to them. A
drip campaign can be designed to re-engage inactive users, reward your very
loyal users, or nurture prospects in the early stages of the sales cycle to
move closer to conversion.

### Personalize messages

Mass marketing shouldn’t mean treating your customers en masse. Salesforce%reg;
found that [58% of consumers](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2016/11/swap-data-for-personalized-marketing.html)
consider a personalized experience to be very important when purchasing from a
company, while 52% said they’re somewhat likely to switch brands if a company
doesn’t personalize communications to them.

Marketing automation software makes it easy to segment your contacts by relevant
information like industry, age range, location, and more. With some marketing
automation platforms like Salesforce Marketing Cloud, you can use dynamic
content&mdash;content that changes depending on the customer group&mdash;to
engage each segment of your audience with messages that are relevant to them.

Segmentation enables you to provide higher-quality interactions for a more
personalized customer experience. Consider using dynamic content across landing
pages, email copy, web forms, and calls-to-action to match the personal interests,
needs and pain points of each segment of your target market.

### Manage non-valuable contacts

Your marketing automation platform doesn’t just help you use your lead data more
effectively&mdash;it can also help you manage the contacts that are not valuable
leads for your business.

Use error reporting to sort out leads that aren’t moving forward in your sales
cycle as quickly as you’d expect. You can funnel leads that are still relevant,
but aren't ready to purchase, into a segment to be further nurtured with
marketing messaging. For example, you can identify low-engagement contacts who
haven’t opened or engaged with your emails in a while and create a re-engagement
campaign to try to bring them back on board before you decide that they are
inactive. For those that don’t fall into this category,
[create a process](https://blog.marketo.com/2016/11/20-ideas-from-power-users-to-power-up-your-b2b-marketing-automation.html)
for handling unsubscribes, invalid, inactive, or blacklisted contacts. This is
especially helpful for improving your email deliverability scores.

You don’t want to continue sending emails to a contact whose email address is
invalid, or bounces every time&mdash;the message isn’t reaching the intended
recipient, and the result only lowers your email open rates and click rates.
Leverage your marketing automation platform to create a smooth process for
removing these contacts from your marketing messaging. Clean, organized lists
in your marketing automation platform improve your

and raise your efficiency.
