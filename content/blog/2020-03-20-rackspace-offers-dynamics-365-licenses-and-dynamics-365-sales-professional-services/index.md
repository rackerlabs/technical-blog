With the current Microsoft 365 services, the Dynamics 365 platform is a natural
fit with the Rackspace Microsoft offerings. Microsoft 365 tools are popular
productivity and collaboration tools. In conjunction with Dynamics 365, these
applications offer a modern and unified experience. Businesses can further
enhance their productivity with robust integration capabilities, such as
Dynamics 365 Sales and Microsoft 365 applications, including Outlook&reg;, Word,
Excel&reg;, and Teams. When you include the Microsoft Power Platform, businesses can
streamline processes like approvals or collaboration through Microsoft Teams.

### What Dynamics 365 offers

Dynamics 365 offers a unified interface, which can use Microsoft Azure&reg;
Active Directory to manage logins across the Microsoft Cloud Platform. This
interface enables users to either work in Dynamics 365 through Outlook or to
navigate seamlessly between Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 applications.

Dynamics 365 also offers modern, intelligent, and adaptable CRM and Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) solutions. Dynamics 365 manages business process
requirements for small businesses, medium businesses, and even enterprise
businesses. Its broad set of applications keep scalability in mind.
