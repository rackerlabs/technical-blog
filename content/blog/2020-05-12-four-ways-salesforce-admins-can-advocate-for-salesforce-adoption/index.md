Using Salesforce&reg; to manage your customer and prospect data saves time and helps you stay organized. However, for Salesforce to make a difference, you need to get everyone on board. Buy-in from the whole company is key to effectively using a Customer Relationship Manager (CRM). Change can be hard for people, but getting buy-in from the whole organization is worth it in the long run. If you’re a Salesforce admin and you don’t have a commitment from everyone in your organization, it’s time to get to work.

Here are some ways you can improve Salesforce adoption in your company.

### Figure out why people aren’t buying in

Are people averse to using Salesforce just because it’s something new, or do they find the way you have it set up to be confusing? There are lots of reasons why people in your organization might be resisting your attempts to get them on board. [In one Salesforce poll](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2018/tips-resources-adoption-awesome-admin-community), administrators reported that employees' top reasons for avoiding adoption included not having the time, not seeing the value, and not knowing how to use it. These are all things you can address. Ask your colleagues about their reservations and then make a plan to tackle them. An in-person training or a lunch-and-learn can convert people who are resistant to Salesforce for any reason.

### Streamline the Salesforce workflow

The easier Salesforce is to use, the more likely it is that people buy into its advantages. Streamline the features in a way that integrates your team’s most used programs, so that access to data is painless. Take advantage of the Salesforce  offering to customize your homepage dashboard and the dashboards of your team members. Create simple drop-down menus and remove anything from the dashboard that your team doesn't need. Your team should be able to access personalized reports for their individual roles and other vital data within a few seconds of logging in.

### Turn on Chatter and encourage its use

Chatter might also encourage faster adoption of Salesforce. Chatter lets team members work together within Salesforce, rather than having to use a different instant messaging (IM) service. The Chatter feed tracking feature keeps employees informed about things like new contacts and training opportunities. Chatter helps you consolidate discussions and keep it all in the same platform.


### Test drive your strategy with a small team first

Before you try to win over everyone to Salesforce, beta test your killer dashboard and Chatter groups with a small group of receptive people. Not only can you work out any problems before deploying training at scale, but your beta testers can become huge Salesforce advocates around the office. Having a handful of excited advocates on your side can make all the difference in how the rest of the team perceives Salesforce.

Salesforce has many features, from killer visual reports on the dashboard to quality lead tracking and communication. But you won’t get anywhere if only a few people are buying into the potential. Take advantage of all these features and convince a small, influential group about the value of using Salesforce. Soon you’ll be able to expand the use of the program to manage your customer relationships better.
