This post introduces the concept of data mining and describes some widely
accepted techniques.

### Introduction

It's no misnomer that data volume is growing and is vital for any organization.
Data mining is at the crux of all the decision-making that happens within
organizations these days.

### What is data mining?

Simply put, data mining extracts meaningful and useful information from a large
set of raw data.

The data and databases come from various data sources, and you can store them
in different data warehouses. You might assume that *data mining* refers to the
extraction of raw data, but that's incorrect. Data mining involves sifting
through your collected data to find meaningful patterns and trends. You can
then use your analysis to detect fraud, market data or services, manage
credit risk, filter unwanted mail or messages, or explore consumer opinion.

### Techniques

Organizations widely practice the following data mining techniques (*Sources*:
[Data Mining Techniques](https://www.guru99.com/data-mining-tutorial.html) and
[The 7 Most Important Data Mining Techniques](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-7-most-important-data-mining-techniques)):

- **Sequential patterns**: This technique identifies patterns in your data sets
  that occur at regular intervals. For example, the sale of specific products
  might spike just before the holidays or more people visit your portal on the
  weekend.

- **Classification**: You can use this technique to retrieve relevant information
  about data and metadata and categorize data in different classes. You can also
  draw further conclusions about classified data. For instance, if you're
  evaluating data on individual customers' financial background and purchase
  history, you can determine their credit risk. Based on that information, you
  can learn even more about the behavior of these customers.

- **Association**: This data mining technique helps to find the association
  between two or more data items. You can identify specific events or attributes
  that show a high correlation with another event or attribute. Association
  enables you to discover a hidden pattern in the data set. For instance, you
  might notice that when your customer purchases a specific item, they also
  often buy a related product. This information helps to populate the
  **People Also Bought** section of online stores.

- **Outlier detection**: Outer detection, also called outlier analysis or outlier
  mining, involves observing data items in the data set that do not match the
  expected pattern or behavior. You can use this technique to identify intrusion
  and fraud. In banking systems, data outliers, such as a sudden spike in online
  spending, transactions from foreign locations, multiple transitions within
  minutes, raise a red flag.

- **Clustering**: Clustering, while similar to classification, involves grouping
  chunks of data together based on their similarities. This process highlights
  the differences and similarities between the data. For instance, you might
  choose to treat different clusters of your audience based on demographics such
  as their income or viewing habits.

- **Regression**: Regression identifies and analyzes the relationship between
variables. You can use it to determine the likelihood of a specific variable
occurring based on the presence of other variables. For example, you could project
price based on availability, consumer demand, and competition. Regression helps
you to uncover the exact relationship between variables in each data set.

- **Prediction**: You can use prediction, one of the most valuable data mining
techniques, to project the types of data you'll see in the future. Prediction
combines data mining techniques like trends, sequential patterns,
clustering, classification, and others. It analyzes past events or instances in
sequence to predict a future event. For example, you might review consumers'
previous purchases to predict the maximum amount they'll spend on a product. It
can also help you to identify target customers for a new launch.

### Conclusion

Data mining helps organizations make precise and correct decisions. It helps you
run successful campaigns, make predictions, and analyze customer behavior.
You can expect effective results by using any of the techniques described in
this post.
