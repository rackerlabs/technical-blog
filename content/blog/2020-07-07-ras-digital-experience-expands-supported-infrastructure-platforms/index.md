RAS Digital Experience solutions have been available on the Rackspace Technology
Dedicated, Server Virtualization, Azure&reg;, and AWS&reg; offerings as a
standard for the solutions.

<!--more-->

On Tuesday, July 7, 2020, RAS Digital Experience expanded the infrastructure
platforms on which the solutions are available. RAS Digital Experience for
Adobe&reg; Experience Manager (AEM) and customer Java&reg;-based applications
are now available on Managed Google&reg; Cloud Platform (MGCP) with the Manage
& Operate service block. The team consulted with customers, the AEM, and Java
architects and engineers and determined that those applications are best suited
for MGCP at this time.

We also launched support for all Digital Experience solutions on Rackspace
Private Cloud-VMware&reg; (RPC-V) on Tuesday, July 7, 2020. There is a
caveat&mdash;you knew there had to be one.

We don't offer Digital Experience solutions on RPC-V on AWS at this time. We
need to conduct additional engineering work to ensure a Fanatical Experience on
that platform.

The RAS Digital team is continuously listening to customer requests and market
demands as we work to meet and exceed them. With the addition of MGCP and RPC-V
to the supported infrastructures for RAS Digital Experience Solutions, customers
who use those platforms benefit from Rackspace's expertise in Digital applications
and our managed services for those applications. This means your engineers,
developers, system administrators, and technical managers can focus on the nuts
and bolts of your business without worrying about the infrastructure.
