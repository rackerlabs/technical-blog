Many business-to-business (B2B) companies know they need marketing automation
to stay relevant and reduce workload. However, they do not always know which
tools they need or how to use these tools to drive transformative business value.

Salesforce&reg; Journey Builder is a Marketing Cloud feature that integrates
with your Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. Although Journey Builder is often
associated with strategies for abandoned carts and Business to customer (B2C)
companies, having used this tool for the past six years, I have seen how powerful
it can be for B2B companies.

This blog explains how you can use Journey Builder to streamline the customer
experience and internal processes at your B2B company.

### What is Journey Builder and how does it work?

Journey Builder is a feature of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. It helps
companies engage with their customers at every step along the path from lead to
loyalty. While B2B companies often choose Pardot for their needs, I have seen
how effective Journey Builder &mdash;and Marketing Cloud as a whole&mdash; can
be for B2B companies.

Journey Builder tracks the behavior of each lead and includes your marketing,
accounting, sales, and customer service teams in lead monitoring. Nearly
anything a lead does, from downloading a whitepaper to logging a service request,
can update the lead’s data and
[trigger the next appropriate touchpoint](https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/definition/Salesforce-Journey-Builder).
Tracking this information gives your company greater visibility into customer
activity and helps you make decisions with real-time information. As a result,
your teams are better able to sell to leads, and your customers enjoy a better
experience, wherever they are on the buyer’s journey.

Journey Builder is part of the Salesforce suite and integrates with other
Salesforce products, like Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. So all your data is
stored in one centralized location, providing a seamless experience for your
employees and customers. It also boosts internal productivity, because your
teams can work in other Salesforce products using the Journey Builder tool.

### How can your B2B company use Journey Builder?

These are a few of the many ways B2B companies in a wide range of industries
can use Journey Builder to boost Return on investment (ROI).

#### Optimize Leads and Opportunities

Journey Builder helps your company make the most of the leads and opportunities
without requiring more time from your sales team. For example, if a lead hasn’t
changed status after 30 days, Journey Builder can automatically add them to a
nurture campaign and send them personalized content based on their behavior.
You can also use the tool to update lead status. For instance, you might decide
that any lead who engages with a specific link in one of your nurture emails
converts to a contact with an opportunity in Sales Cloud.

Automating these actions with Journey Builder saves your sales team effort and
ensures they can spend their time on the leads most likely to convert.

##### Automate simple communications

Journey Builder can use data from any standard or custom object that has a
lookup relationship to your leads and contacts.

So you can use Journey Builder to:

- Replace sales calls with automated surveys from lost opportunities.
- Send upcoming renewal reminders for customer subscriptions.
- Notify customers to upgrade to your latest product and more.

Leveraging Journey Builder for these tasks ensures that your consumers get
timely notifications and updates while allowing your sales and service employees
to focus on more intensive tasks.

##### Manage partner relationships

Journey Builder can help with onboarding partners and wholesalers. You can set
up an automated journey for all new partners, easily providing them with
introductions, media kits, and anything else they need to make the partnership
successful.


##### Create drip campaigns

Use Journey Builder to create a drip campaign and strategically extend your new
product announcement over one to two weeks instead of sending a single manual
email. This strategy likely drives more interest among your customers as well
as provide information about engagement with your emails. Journey Builder
provides statistics and updates at every step, so you can easily conduct
reporting and continually use this data to inform your marketing strategy.

##### Improve internal processes

Journey Builder not only helps boost your customer experience&mdash;it can also
streamline workflows for your internal teams.

- **Reduce workloads**. Replace the repetitive tasks performed by your sales and
  marketing teams, like manually sending emails with automated processes.
- **Update leads**. Ensure better data hygiene and more accurate customer information.
- **Support your sales team**. Send users progress update emails on behalf of
  the sales team when they are close to reaching their targets.
- **Assign tasks on time**. Automatically assign a salesperson to a lead based
  on their activity &mdash;for example, if a lead reads your whitepaper.

With so many diverse use cases, Journey Builder is a powerful tool for B2B
companies that have a solid foundation in place.

#### Getting the most out of Journey Builder

You need more than just the technology to take full advantage of Journey Builder
at your B2B company. Although Marketing Cloud implementation is essential to
using Journey Builder, your marketing strategy ultimately determines your
success with this tool.

Defining buyer personas ensures you have a sound understanding of your target
customers. You can then use these profiles to create workflows for the different
buyer’s journeys to make sure you provide leads with the
[right messaging, at the right time](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/marketing-automation-2/marketing-automation-b2b-best-practices/)&mdash;which
is the exact goal of using Journey Builder.
