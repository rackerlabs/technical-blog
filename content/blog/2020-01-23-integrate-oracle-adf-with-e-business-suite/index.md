### ADF

Oracle describes ADF in
[Oracle Fusion Middleware Understanding Oracle Application Development Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/adf/ADFCG/intro.htm#ADFCG111) in the following way:

“Oracle Application Development Framework (Oracle ADF) is an end-to-end
application framework that builds on Java EE standards and open-source
technologies to simplify and accelerate implementing enterprise applications.
Oracle ADF is suitable for enterprise developers who want to create applications
that search, display, create, modify, and validate data using web, mobile, and
desktop interfaces.

“You can use the whole Oracle ADF framework to create an application, or you
can use parts of the framework in combination with the other technologies.
Throughout this guide, applications that contain any ADF technologies are
generally referred to as ADF applications. Web applications that incorporate
ADF technologies throughout the business service, model, controller, and view
layers are referred to as Fusion web applications.”


### SWPA

Oracle describes SPWA in [FAQ For 12.2.5 - SPWA - Supply Planning Work Area](https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/More%20Applications%20and%20Technologies/2049195_1.html) in the following way:

“The Supply Planning Work Area (SPWA) is a component of the Oracle Advanced
Supply Chain Planning (ASCP).

“12.2.5 VCP introduces a new form for users that is an alternative to the
planner workbench. The standard Planner Workbench is still available and will
not be removed from the applications.

“This form uses the same ADF (Application Development Framework) tech stack that
powers Rapid Planning and Fusion applications&mdash;part of the Fusion Middle Ware
(FMW) tech stac. This does not use standard Oracle Forms tech stack that
has been the standard for the last 15+ years.

“It depends on your WebLogic tech stack and ADF rendering of the forms.”


### Integrate ADF with SWPA

In EBS version 12.2.5 and later,  Oracle introduced SPWA, which replaced the
Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) Planner Workbench in earlier EBS releases.

Use the following steps to integrate ADF with EBS v12.2:

1. Download and install a new or separate WebLogic Server (WLS), version 10.3.6.
2. Download and install ADF Runtime version 11.1.1.9.0.
3. Configure the WLS domain.
4. Create a new managed server in WebLogic.
5. Create a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) data source.
6. Set up an Oracle Metadata Services (MDS) repository.
7. Start the administrative and managed servers.
8. Deploy the Planning UI application.
9. Set the Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning (MSC) profile in EBS.

#### 1. Download and install a new or separate WebLogic Server, version 10.3.6

Download the software from the following URL:

[https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-installers-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-installers-downloads.html)

To install the WLS, use the following steps:

1. Stage this in the file system.

2. Make sure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.6 or later.

3. Set the JDK Home by using the following command:

        export JDK_HOME=/u01/utilities/jdk160_29)

4. Install it by running one of the following commands:

   If the installation file type is **jar**, run the following command:

        $(JAVA_HOME)/bin/java –jar wls1036_generic.jar

   If the installation file type is **bin**, run the following command:

        ./wls1036_linux32.bin

Provide the following inputs during the installation process as needed and
complete the installation:

-	Provide the Middleware home directory where you want to install the WLS.
-	Choose the install type ``Typical``.
-	Select the JDK location where you installed the JDK.


#### 2. Download and install ADF Runtime version 11.1.1.9.0

Download the software from the following URL:

[https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/application-development-framework-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/application-development-framework-downloads.html)

![](Picture2.png)

To install the ADF Runtime, use the following steps:

1. Stage this software in on the Unix server.

2. Run the following commands:

        cd /stage/adf_11.1.1.9.0
        ./runInstaller -jreLoc /u01/utilities/jdk160_29

Provide the following inputs during the installation process as needed and
complete the installation:

complete the installation:

-	Select the first option to generate an automatically configured domain and
    select both the Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) and Java Required Files (JRF).
-	Enter the **Domain Name**, ``ascp_domain``.
-	Provide your WebLogic password.
-	Select **Configure Server Start Mode** in the **Production** mode.
-	Select **Administration Server** on the **Optional Configuration** screen.
-	Change the listener port to the other port if you installed the WLS in the same
    EBS Apps tier.
-   Change to port ``7051``, and if Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is not enabled, uncheck **SSL**.

### Conclusion

SPWA is a new feature that replaces Planner Workbench in earlier releases.

In SPWA, you configure, view, and analyze your real-world business processes.
By using SPWA, you can do the following:

-	View multiple plans and plan inputs simultaneously.
-	Use predefined page layouts.
-	Create user-defined page layouts to view plan data tailored for your organization.

The SPWA form uses ADF and does not use the standard Oracle Forms. To use SPWA,
you need to install and configure both a WLS and ADF and then enable
the user to work on the ADF page from EBS.
