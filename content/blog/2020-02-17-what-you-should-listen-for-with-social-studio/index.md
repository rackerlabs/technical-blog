With all the digital channels of communication out there, you probably have
your work cut out, trying to connect with your entire target market online.
It can be even more challenging to engage with your audience if you don't know
how they feel about your brand. That's because you can't respond to people if
you haven't listened to what they have to say first.

That's where *social listening* comes in. Social listening differs from social
monitoring by offering a more nuanced, contextual look at what people are saying
about your brand on Facebook, Twitter, and more. The knowledge you gain when you
listen to social chatter with a
[program such as Social Studio](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/social-media-marketing/)
can inform how you market your brand online, but only if you
know what to look for.

Read on to find out exactly what you should be listening out for on social
media with the powerful Social Studio tool.

### What people actually think of your brand

The principle purpose of social listening is to see what your customers or
potential customers are saying about your brand. You should use Social Studio
to scour social media platforms for positive mentions of your company, as well
as posts that mention your brand alongside terms like *the worst* and *annoyed.*

according to real-time feedback so that you can plan where to take your messaging.
If customers are consistently complaining about your confusing website, you know
to rethink its design. In the meantime, you can develop a small campaign to
educate people on navigating your site. You can even jump in using your branded
social media account to answer complaints or thank people for their positive
feedback.

### How much your customers don't know

In addition to finding out what your customers do think, Social Studio lets you
take a look at what your target market doesn't know. Why does this help? Getting
a handle on the types of questions people are asking about your brand or
industry better prepares you to join the conversation. Use commonly asked
questions as content inspiration for your social marketing campaigns.

When they detect a spike in questions about Cancun, your travel company responds
by posting a helpful Cancun travel guide. When Social Studio tells that you
people under 35 are asking a lot of questions about whether they should cancel
their cable, your electronics business can share an FAQ blog called "Everything
Millennials Should Know Before Cutting Cable." Figure out what information people
are seeking and then offer it. After all, becoming a well of knowledge builds
trust.

### How social media mentions your competitors

Don't just track your reputation&mdash;go ahead and spy on your biggest
competition with Social Studio, too. See what people don't like about your
competitors and use that information to create an alternative in the marketplace.
Does everyone say your biggest rival needs a price point under $40? Develop a
service package that starts at $39.99 and market it on social media.

Reach out to customers who are complaining about your competitor by searching
for terms like *[competitor brand] can't.* Let them know how your brand can
solve their issue. When you become an active problem solver, you might be able
to bring on eager customers who are dissatisfied with their current service.

### The influential accounts that you need to know

Social media influencers start a lot of the dialog in your industry. Let
Social Studio identify accounts with a large number of followers who frequently
mention your brand or the industry topics that you care about. An influencer
who recommends you highly can become a
[social media partner](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/8-ways-to-use-social-listening-for-your-business/),
sharing your content, or reviewing your product. You can engage an influential
account that is skeptical of your product for constructive criticisms. You might
be able to turn the relationship around, but only if you know what they're saying.

You should also listen for relevant hashtags, particularly ones used by
influencers. When people mention your brand or industry, do they also tag it
with #Marketing101? Start hopping into the hashtag with your own content.

Social listening gives you a voyeuristic view of what people think of you, your
competitors, and your industry at large. Stop engaging with customers based on
a hunch and start developing marketing campaigns informed by what people
actually want and need. Contact Rackspace today to find out how we can help you
devise an effective social media strategy for your business.
