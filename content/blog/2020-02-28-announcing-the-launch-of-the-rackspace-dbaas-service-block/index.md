Rackspace recently introduced the concept of Service Blocks, which provides you
with a defined, streamlined path to achieve specific data, infrastructure, and
application management and transformation initiatives. We designed Service Blocks
to give you the flexibility to engage with the necessary service and expertise,
without forcing commitments to more than you need. This new model of delivering
services is exceptionally compatible with our platform, so we’re proud to launch
the ObjectRocket® Database-as-a-Service Service Block. Whatever data journey your
company is on, Service Blocks provide both the foundational services that we
recommend to build and maintain a robust data environment and the services to
then transform and modernize your data.

### ObjectRocket DBaaS Service Block overview

ObjectRocket DBaaS takes the burden of database strategy, planning, management,
and administration from your teams so you can focus on core business objectives.
Instead of spending time monitoring database performance, scaling resources, and
troubleshooting issues, you can turn your team’s attention toward building new
capabilities and growing your business.

ObjectRocket provides fully managed, automated, and highly available products and
services, including MongoDB®, Elasticsearch®, PostgreSQL, Redis®, and CockroachDB,
which our expert DBAs and customer data engineers support. Customers get
instant access to production-ready instances with the latest database
technologies, elastic resources to shrink and grow capacity, and performance
based on your application’s needs&mdash;all on a secure platform that is
monitored and maintained by a team of database experts.

With this service, ObjectRocket ensures that the database is reliable, scalable,
and fast by helping customers with the entire project&mdash;from critical early
decisions such as data replication and modeling to security assessments and
architecture guidance to round-the-clock monitoring and support.

### Focused on solutions

  technologies for each use case, taking the guesswork out of picking a new
