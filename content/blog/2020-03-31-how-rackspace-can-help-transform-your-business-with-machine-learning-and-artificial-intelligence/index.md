Not all organizations have the technical skills and business processes to implement AI/ML solutions. Luckily,
Rackspace does. The data engineering and data science experts at Rackspace can help you get the most out of your
data by using leading cloud-native AI/ML frameworks at scale. These experts cover the following areas for your business:

- AI/ML assessment and strategy
- AI transformation


## AI/ML assessment and strategy

Rackspace helps you to visualize how AI/ML can improve your business, then works with you to develop a practical
solution that focuses on technology and business transformation. At the end of this process, you receive a defined
business use case, a proposed AI/ML solution definition and scope, and a technical roadmap for implementation.
The AI/ML assessment and strategy solution includes:

- **AI/ML workshop:** Rackspace data architects and scientists conducts an on-site workshop to discuss how businesses similar
to yours are currently leveraging data and AI/ML, ideate solutions for high-priority use cases, and decide whether a
proof-of-concept or a prototype is necessary.

- **AI/ML strategy:** Rackspace spends two&mdash;four weeks prioritizing use cases according to business needs and solution
complexity, assessing your current data platform, defining a high-level architecture, and conducting an initial long-range planning (LRP) session to define the implementation roadmap.


### AI transformation

Rackspace helps you leverage AI/ML by using best practices to implement a prototype or proof-of-concept AI/ML solution
for your data. Rackspace can also immediately begin working if you are ready for a full production solution, including
data infrastructure and AI/ML model development and deployment. This feature also helps facilitate process documentation
and knowledge transfer. The AI transformation solution includes:

- **AI/ML solution architecture and design:** Rackspace reviews the customer’s use case, data quality, and existing data
infrastructure and uses it to design an enterprise-grade production AI/ML solution.

- **Data integration:** Rackspace develops an overall data lake and data pipeline strategy and builds a large,
high-quality training dataset that includes data ingestion, data preparation, data segregation, and pipeline automation.
