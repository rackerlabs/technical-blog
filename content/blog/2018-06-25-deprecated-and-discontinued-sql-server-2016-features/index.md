This blog identifies the deprecated Microsoft&reg; SQL Server&reg; Database Engine
features that are available in SQL Server 2016 and that will be removed in future
releases of SQL Server.

<!--more-->

### Introduction

You often read about new features in SQL Server releases. However, you do not
always find discussions about the deprecated features when you are planning
to upgrade databases to a newer version. Because the rollback feature is not
available during upgrades, you need to understand the deprecated features
before you migrate production databases. The following sections provide details
about features that will be discontinued in SQL Server releases after SQL Server
2016.

### Backup and restore

The following list shows the status of various backup and restore operations:

- Full and transaction log backups with a media password are already obsolete,
  but you can restore backups with a media password in SQL Server 2016. This
  feature will be removed in a future release.

- The ``restore {database | log} with [media]password`` operation is deprecated.

- The ``backup {database | log} with password`` and
  ``backup {database | log} with [media]password`` operations are discontinued.

### Compatibility levels

You can't upgrade directly from version 110 (SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008
R2). Instead, you must first upgrade the database to SQL Server 2012 and then
upgrade the database to the current version. However, database compatibility
level 100 is supported. Compatibility levels are only available for the last
two versions of SQL Server.

### Encryption

Encryption using RC4 or RC4\_128 is deprecated and is scheduled to be removed
in the next version of SQL Server. Decrypting RC4 and RC4\_128 is not
deprecated. You should start using another encryption algorithm such as AES.

### Remote stored procedures

Remote stored procedures start after a Transact-SQL distributed transaction is
executed by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC).

Remote servers are supported in SQL Server 2016 for backward compatibility only.
New applications should use linked servers instead.

### Table hints

The table hint ``WITH`` keyword feature is deprecated and will be removed in
future versions of SQL Server. Newly developed apps should not use the ``WITH``
keyword.

### Separating hints with spaces

The ability to separate hints with spaces (instead of commas) will be removed
in an upcoming version of SQL Server. Do not use this feature in any new
development work and modify applications that currently use this feature as soon
as possible.

### SQLMaint utility

The SQLMaint utility executes database maintenance plans created with previous
versions of SQL Server. This feature will be made obsolete in future versions.
Replace this utility with the SQL Server maintenance plan feature.

### Features discontinued in SQL Server 2016

The following features were discontinued in SQL Server 2016:

-  SQL Server 2016 is a 64-bit application. The 32-bit installation was
   discontinued, though some elements of SQL Server 2016 still run as 32-bit
   components.

-  Compatibility level 90 was discontinued.

-  The ActiveX subsystem was discontinued. Use command line or PowerShell
   scripts instead.

### Conclusion

The deprecated features listed in this blog will be removed in a future release
of SQL Server, but Microsoft has not scheduled when the removals will happen.
Test old applications before migrating to a new version of SQL Server, and
do not use deprecated features in any new development work.
