This article reviews geofencing or geolocation&mdash;a capability within FSL. We
discuss the definition of geofencing, as well as how and when you should expect
to phase it into your FSL implementation.

### What is Geofencing?

Geofencing enables you to set up virtual perimeters around predefined areas and
then create rules for these “fenced” locations. It uses a blend of the Global
Positioning System (GPS), cellular data, and Wi-Fi signals.

Geofencing adds value to your business in many ways. It enables your customers
to see how far technicians are from their location and can also automatically
let customers know about any delay. Use geofencing to automate processes like
assigning work to technicians based on their location. Geofencing trigger
operational activities, like a stock center getting parts when a technician is
within a certain distance. It also triggers post-event actions, such as closing
tickets after a techician leaves the location.

While geofencing is a great enhancement, it is not a catch-all panacea. You
should consider several factors before implementing geofencing.

### Geofencing requires planning before implementation

Using geofencing at the beginning of your FSL project is certainly an option,
but it might not be the best idea. To get the most out of geofencing, you should
first consider all factors. Far too often, companies skip the planning step
entirely, and as a result, encounter problems along the way.

### Things to consider before you start geofencing

We advise our clients to consider a few things before implementing geofencing.
First of all, geolocation is not as accurate as most people think. The accuracy
of the pinpointed location is usually within 10 meters. This is why when you
use a ride-sharing app to call for a car, your driver might sometimes think you
are at Location A when you are actually standing one block away at Location B.
This adds a layer of complexity when using geolocation to connect your field
workers with your customers.

As another example, your technician has an appointment at House A and another
appointment at House B, which is 10 meters away. When they pull into the driveway,
it is difficult for geolocation technology to determine exactly which appointment
is about to begin. One solution to this problem might be to set up time
dependencies in your system, creating limitations based on appointment start and
end times. Doing this is helpful in theory, but introduces another layer of
complexity if your technician finishes their appointment early. Now, they can
move on to the next job at House C, ahead of schedule for the day. In this case,
you need a solution that allows technicians to manually update appointment times
and notify customers of any changes to their scheduled appointment.

What about offline technicians? Geofencing enables you to send automatic
notifications to your customer when their technician is within five meters of
their house. For companies whose technicians frequently work outside of a service
network, or are otherwise offline, this particular feature might not add much
value. Mobile FSL gives you the capability to update work orders while offline
and synchronize completed work when a connection is available. However, while
the technician is offline, location information isn’t updated in real time, so
your customers miss any notifications that rely on geolocation. Depending on how
often your technicians have online access, this might or might not be a
worthwhile use of geofencing for your business.

These are just a few of the things you should consider before using geofencing.
We recommend working with an experienced implementation partner to cover all of
your bases and correctly set up your geofencing capabilities.
