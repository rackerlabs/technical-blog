### Introduction

This two-part blog series covers the steps required to install or upgrade
Discoverer within an existing E-Business Suite (EBS) R12 instance. Part 1
discusses the installation of the software required for the Discoverer 11.1.1.7
upgrade.

**Note**: Discoverer 11g (11.1.1.7) is now certified with the Oracle EBS Release.
Discoverer 11.1.1.7 (terminal discoverer version) is part of Oracle Fusion
Middleware 11g Release 1 Version 11.1.1.7.0, also known as FMW 11gR1 Patchset 6.

Certified E-Business Suite releases are:

-	EBS Release 11i 11.5.10.2 + ATG RUP 7 and higher

-	EBS Release 12.0.6 and higher

-	EBS Release 12.1.1 and higher

For more information about certification, see the following links:

-  https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/downloads/fmw-11gr1certmatrix.xls

**Note**: If you are using Red Hat&reg; Linux (RHEL), you must be on version 6 or
lower before you can install Discoverer 11.1.1.7.

### Installation of required software

Before installing or upgrading to Discoverer 11.1.1.7, download the following
software:

-	Oracle WebLogic 10.3.5 or 10.3.6 (Oracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.7.0 is
   certified with WebLogic Server versions 10.3.5 and 10.3.6)

-	Oracle Portal, Forms, Reports and Discoverer 11g 11.1.1.2

-	Oracle Portal, Forms, Reports and Discoverer 11g Patch Set 6 (11.1.1.7.0)
   (patch ID 16471668)

-	Repository Creation Utility (RCU) for creating the database schemas

#### Oracle WebLogic installation

Before proceeding, ensure that you are not using the default JDK (for 64bit OS).
Instead, use JDK 1.7.0_07 or a similar version.

Use the following steps for the Oracle WebLogic Server 11gR1 (10.3.6) installation.

1. Run the following command to start the installation:

    `<JDK_PATH>/bin/java -d64 -jar -Djava.io.tmpdir=<temp_dir_loc> ./wls1036_generic.jar -log=<loc/filename>`

2. Click **Next** on the **Welcome** screen.

3. Create the new Middleware home by specifying the location.

4. Provide Oracle support credentials (if required).

5. Choose the install type, either typical (recommended) or custom.

6. Select local JDK installed, as shown in the following image.

#### RCU installation

The RCU download package should be about 350 MB. This utility creates two
new users and three new tablespaces, which are used to store metadata for
Middleware and Discoverer.

Use the following steps for the installation process:

1. Click **Next** on the **Welcome** screen.

2. Choose **Create** to create the repository.

3. Provide the database connection details.

4. Select **Create new prefix**. Provide the prefix name and select the component,
   such as **Discoverer**, under the Portal & BI label.

5. Enter the schema password.

6. Ensure that the correct default and temporary (temp) tablespaces are showing.
   If the tablespaces are incorrect, modify them.  The following image shows
   this step:
