In the financial services sector, Salesforce&reg; stands head and shoulders
above the other customer relationship management (CRM) and cloud computing
platforms out there. That’s because Salesforce designed its
[Financial Services Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/financial-services/financial-services-cloud/)
with financial services in mind, enabling you to connect with your clients
more personally than ever before.

As Strategic Alliance Executive at Rackspace, and formerly Regional Vice
President at RelationEdge, I’ve worked with many financial services companies
to support their digital transformation and business process improvements. I’ve
seen firsthand how Salesforce makes a difference in this industry for the
following reasons:

- The security and trust features
- The investment in understanding the financial services industry
- The degree of customizability to suit unique company needs

In this post, I dive into each of these three points to show how Salesforce can
help take your financial services company to the next level.

### Security and trust features

Salesforce is known as the most secure CRM platform available. It’s not only the
system the [Department of Defense uses](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/government/resources/cloud-computing-dod-approved-software-list/),
but it is also the platform chosen by [U.S. Bank&reg;](https://www.salesforce.com/customer-success-stories/us-bank/),
[Transamerica&reg;](https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2017/03/170328/),
[Western Union&reg;](https://www.salesforce.com/customer-success-stories/western-union/),
and numerous other financial institutions for its robust features and reliable
data security.

Financial services companies don’t just need to be vigilant against external
hacks. They also have to ensure that client information isn’t shared across
business lines. Salesforce’s security and trust features well serve these
special security needs. Salesforce features provide advanced configurations
for top security, boosting trust among your clients as they share their most
sensitive data with you.

### Deep understanding of the industry

Salesforce Financial Services Cloud was
[created with the input](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/08/salesforce-financial-services-cloud.html)
of wealth management companies and independent software vendors. Gathering
this input is representative of the time Salesforce has invested in understanding the financial
services industry.

Through consultations with industry experts and ongoing events for financial
services professionals, Salesforce has come to truly understand the financial
industry&mdash;and it shows in their products. You can be confident that your
Salesforce solution can meet your specific needs, especially with the
available customizations.

### Highly customizable

Financial service companies vary widely, from banking and insurance to wealth
management and investing, and each sector of financial services operates very
differently.

Salesforce has the
[customizability to support them all](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/financial-services/overview/).
Financial advisors, for instance, can leverage Salesforce to deliver
personalized relationships to each of their clients. Bankers can use the
platform to gain more insight about their customers and identify opportunities
to convert and cross-sell their target market. All sectors can benefit from the
technology’s ability to streamline client communications, increase data security,
and integrate omni-channel efforts.

In fact, Salesforce has so many options that our clients can sometimes feel
overwhelmed by the possibilities&mdash;that’s where we come in to help.

We encourage our clients to avoid trying to boil the ocean. Instead, as you
implement Salesforce, focus on the key areas and problems to
address. For your organization, the focus might be on risk management, financial
reporting timeliness, or regulatory compliance. Identify the top challenges you
need your technology solution to help solve. Doing this enables you and your
implementation partner to develop a minimum viable product that addresses your
key needs, and then build and expand on that solution.

As a starting point, aside from using Salesforce Financial Cloud, we have found
that many financial services companies benefit from customizing and using the
following Salesforce services:

- **[Sales Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/sales-cloud/overview/)**: To find clients and grow accounts to improve the lead-to-loyalty cycle.
- **[Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/)**: To help with marketing automation that is GDPR-compliant, if necessary.
- **[Service Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/overview/)**: To increase client satisfaction and improve customer support.
- **[Community Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/community-cloud/overview/)**: To provide clients with excellent self-service options and account portals.
- **[Einstein AI](https://www.salesforce.com/products/sales-cloud/features/sales-cloud-einstein/)**: To leverage AI-powered predictions and recommendations to improve internal decision making, increase productivity, and create a better customer experience.

### Conclusion

Working with an implementation partner like Rackspace is invaluable when it
comes to customizing your Salesforce solution. Our team of experts provides
technical guidance and best practice advice based on their wealth of experience
working with similar businesses. The result&mdash;your financial services company
gets the best solution in the most reasonable time frame possible.
