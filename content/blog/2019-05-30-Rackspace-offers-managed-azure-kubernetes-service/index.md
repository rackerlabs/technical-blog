As a Microsoft&reg; Azure&reg; Expert Managed Service Provider, Rackspace is
focused on delivering high-value services for customers who are actively running
cloud-native applications and for customers who are interested in modernizing
existing applications to take advantage of the performance, availability, and
cost savings that they can realize by leveraging a container-based microservices
architecture.

### Introduction

Rackspace’s **Fanatical Support for Azure** offering continues to evolve, and
we are excited to announce that our most recent enhancement to our managed
services helps our customers remove the difficulty of architecting, deploying,
and operating Kubernetes&reg; at scale and helps customers choose the right
solution for their needs to deliver containers services in Azure. We have
developed a set of management capabilities for the Azure Kubernetes Service
(AKS) that allows our customers to accelerate their Kubernetes journey and
align their digital transformation and container strategies.

Adopting newer technologies into production environments can present significant
challenges for businesses of all sizes. Rackspace works with our customers
across the entire lifecycle of a Kubernetes service, from application inception
through production deployment. Additionally, the effort to make AKS
production-ready in a specific application environment requires deep Kubernetes
skill sets, broad Azure experience, and a 24x7x365 Cloud Operations team that
many customers prefer not to develop on their own.

Our customers not only need assistance in setting up their AKS environment with
the right performance, availability, and cost designs in mind, but they also
need assistance to meet their specific security requirements. Our **Fanatical
Support for Azure** offering helps our customers simplify the process to set
network policies and provide Azure role-based access and security management
capabilities that are needed to securely reach the compliance and regulatory
controls within their AKS environments.

Rackspace’s deep partnership with Microsoft enables us to consider the features
and capabilities customers are looking for as they adopt containers within
Rackspace managed environments and start moving more production workloads to
Azure. Rackspace consistently delivers new sets of capabilities and provides
customers with the management services for the solutions that they require.
