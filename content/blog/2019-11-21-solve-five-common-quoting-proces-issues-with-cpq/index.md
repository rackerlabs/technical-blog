### Introduction

Issues in your quoting process&mdash;from pricing errors to lengthy approvals&mdash;can
prevent your team from meeting customer expectations, and contribute to a
lack of morale among your staff.

In our experience helping businesses improve their quote-to-cash system, we’ve
seen these roadblocks countless times. In our well-established Configure, Price,
Quote (CPQ) practice at Rackspace, we’ve been able to help guide businesses in
implementing the right tools and processes to tackle these common pain points
and prevent them from reappearing down the line.

One of the best tools you can invest in to alleviate this is the Salesforce&reg;
CPQ application. Salesforce CPQ acts as a guardrail
for your sales process, helping your team quickly provide accurate pricing
across a range of scenarios. It facilitates your quoting process from the first
interaction with a client right up to the final calculations&mdash;and it doesn’t
end there, thanks to streamlined review and follow-up capabilities.

This post covers five of the most rampant quoting process issues we’ve seen,
some solutions, and a look at how CPQ can help mitigate these problems.

### 1. Outdated information

Keeping your organization’s information up-to-date can be difficult, especially
if you’re in the midst of restructuring or
(have many systems to keep track of)[https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/dont-let-data-silos-downfall/]
across the company.

If you’re using spreadsheets and documents to manage your terms and conditions, price
lists, and other important information, the chances are high that older versions
of these documents are being circulated and used by both team members and clients.

Salesforce and linked cloud-based applications such as CPQ can help centralize
and maintain data. CPQ also acts as your company’s universal access point for
that data. This centralization ensures that every team member has access to the
most current documents and information.

### 2. Pricing (and other) errors

One of the major side effects of having decentralized data across multiple
systems is errors such as price discrepancies, data entry mistakes, and other
blunders that make your quoting process feel more like a hurdle and less like a
bridge to bringing on new customers.

Common issues might be caused by human errors, such as forgetting to update an
information field (like the company’s new name) that causes confusion for the
customer, or miscalculations, such as not realizing a customer is eligible for
free shipping on a particular order.

These errors can result in over or under-charging your customers, filing
inaccurate information, or extra time spent redoing a large quote. Ultimately,
quoting errors cause your team and company to appear disjointed or, worse,
unprofessional.

While it might not be possible to eliminate errors completely, you can take
steps to make these mistakes less likely. Doing so goes a long way towards helping
you to reach your targets and keep your customers happy.

### 3. Lengthy review process

Tired of endless emails and long games of phone tag to get your quote approved?
You are not alone&mdash;going through the necessary reviews and approvals is
one of the most frequently identified pain points of the quoting process. For
companies that still rely on email for communications, this is especially true.

Salesforce CPQ enables you to generate documents, track changes, and integrate
revisions into the quote system so that the final review process is more
efficient and easier to follow up on. This process empowers your team and the customer
to obtain the information and changes they need in a timely manner.

### 4. Missed upsells

While your sales representatives are busy following up on approvals or correcting errors
in a miscalculated quote, they are losing time they could have spent maximizing
the impact of their sales. When sales representatives are spread too thin or required to
spend too much time on manual tasks, they miss out on opportunities to upsell
your current customer base.

Salesforce CPQ helps manage repetitive tasks and removes some of the manual
processes, freeing up time for salespeople to focus on searching for ideal
opportunities to upsell and cross-sell existing customers. CPQ also manages your
quotes and contracts in one centralized system, helping to further highlight
compatibilities and upsell opportunities along the path to generating a quote.

### 5. Excessive discounting

Discounts can be an effective way to motivate and reward customers that use and
bundle your products. However, when you give too many customers overly generous
markdowns or inaccurate discounts, your profits take a hit.

Excessive discounting is common when a sales team doesn’t have an automated
system to perform calculations based on the customer’s profile, or when they
don’t have clearly enforced rules in place to cap discounts.

By using CPQ to set limits on your discount policy and to require different degrees
of approval for discounts, you help ensure that your customers get a fair price
while your company continues to make money.
