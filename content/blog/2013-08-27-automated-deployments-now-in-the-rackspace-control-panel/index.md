The hardest part about using new technology is knowing where to begin. Spending
hours sifting through blog posts and documentation to set up a server environment
is often enough to extinguish the excitement about a new framework or application.
By the same token, it is frustrating to deploy hosting architecture when you are
excited to see how your latest code will perform. And no one likes having to do
the same things over and over to create consistent testing, staging and production
environments.

Deploying your application to the cloud requires expertise in both system
administration and development; often, people have expertise in some areas while
having gaps in others. The Rackspace Deployments service was created so we could
collect this information and expertise in machine and human readable format and
use it to automatically and consistently deploy hosting configurations, frameworks
and applications and alleviate some of this stress.

### Blueprints for success

Our Rackers are experts in [hybrid cloud][1] hosting, so we drew on this knowledge
to create hosting architecture blueprints. The expertise was captured in one
place with simple options that you could select to create your hosting environment.
From the blueprints, a configuration is automatically built on those best practices
that can be immediately used.

### Like Chef or Puppet for the cloud

While [Chef][2] and [Puppet][3] are awesome tools to configure host machines or
VMs, they do fall a little short in deploying full environments: you can’t run
Chef on a Cloud Load Balancer or Cloud Database. This is where the Rackspace
Deployments service comes in. This system looks at the entire topology and
configures your environment (servers, load balancers and databases) in a holistic
way, based on best practices, for you to run your application.

When it is time to configure the application on a host machine, the Rackspace
Deployments service uses Chef or Puppet. Ultimately, our deployment offering is
the orchestrator above everything; it ensures that your environment is setup to
run the application along with verifying the app is configured correctly.

### Battle-tested solution

Our [Managed Cloud][4] team has been using the Rackspace Deployment service to
build and scale out customer configurations. This means that you are getting a
battle-tested solution that has been working in the real world that is ready
for prime time. The Rackspace Deployment Service is actively used by the experts
who know how these applications should run and by Rackers who know how to support
them if something goes awry.

We are excited to roll out the Rackspace Deployments service and to get it in
the hands of our customers. To get started, log into the [Rackspace Control Panel][5],
click the drop down arrow on the **Create Server** menu, and select **Create Deployment**.

We currently offer blueprints for Ruby on Rails, PHP, WordPress, Cassandra,
Drupal, Magento, MySQL with replication, Django and MongoDB. We’re working on
Windows, Node.js, etherpad, and multi-region Cassandra blueprints right now and
new ones are added frequently. Try it out, and let us know what you want
to see on the list!
