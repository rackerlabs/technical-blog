This post discusses how to repair multiple or single block corruption of
data files, including system data files, in an Oracle&reg; database. Block
corruption is a common source of database outages.

<!--more-->

A database block is corrupted when its contents are different than what the
Oracle database expects to find. If block corruption is not prevented or
repaired, the corruption can bring down the database and possibly cause the
loss of key business data.

This is one of the real time issues that you need to face and fix in production
databases.

### Find and fix block corruption

The following image shows a possible block corruption:

#### Find the corruption

To find the corruption, execute the following commands:

    SQL> select * from V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION;

    FILE#    BLOCK#    BLOCKS    CORRUPTION_CHANGE#  CORRUPTION
    ----- ---------- ----------  ------------------  ----------
     352     173191      9               0            ALL ZERO

    SQL> SELECT FILE_ID,RELATIVE_FNO,FILE_NAME,TABLESPACE_NAME FROM DBA_DATA_FILES WHERE FILE_ID=352;

     FILE_ID   RELATIVE_FNO   FILE_NAME                                          TABLESPACE_NAME
    ---------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------- ------------------
        352        352      /u01/apps_st/samusxxxxxxxx_data2/system09.dbf              SYSTEM

    SQL> SELECT owner, segment_name, segment_type FROM dba_extents WHERE RELATIVE_FNO = 352 AND Block_id BETWEEN 173191 AND 173191 + blocks - 1;

    OWNER      SEGMENT_NAME    SEGMENT_TYPE
    -------- ---------------  ------------------
    SYS         I_COL3          INDEX
    SYS         C_OBJ#          CLUSTER

**Note**: In this case, SYS object segment I\_COL3 has a block corruption. The
corrupted block, as reported by the `dbv` command, is shown as free in the
`dba_free_space` view.

#### Free the blocks

To free the blocks for file 352, execute the following commands:

    SQL> select * from V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION;

    FILE#    BLOCK#    BLOCKS    CORRUPTION_CHANGE#  CORRUPTION
    ----- ---------- ----------  ------------------  ----------
     352     173191      9               0            ALL ZERO

    SQL> Select * from dba_free_space where file_id =352 and 173191 between block_id and block_id + blocks -1;

    TABLESPACE_NAME   FILE_ID  BLOCK_ID  BYTES    BLOCKS   RELATIVE_FNO
    ---------------   -------  --------  -----  ---------- ------------
       SYSTEM           352     173191   73728       9        352

#### Force clear blocks

After the blocks are free, you can use the following commands to force clear those
corrupted blocks. This is also known as formatting corrupted blocks that are not
part of any segment.

##### 1. Create a user and grant the user access to the database.

    create user Scott identified by password default tablespace SYSTEM;
    grant resource, connect, create table, create trigger to Scott;

##### 2. Identify the corrupt block against the data file

##### 3. Find the free space

    Select * from dba_free_space where file_id= <Absolute file number> and <corrupted block number> between block_id and block_id + blocks -1;


    SQL> Select * from dba_free_space where file_id=352 and 173191 between block_id and block_id + blocks -1;

##### 4. Reformat first corrupted block

Repeat step 4 until all corrupted blocks are reformatted.

         RAISE corrupt;
       END IF;

    new   8:   IF (dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(:new_p.rowid)=173191)

    Enter value for filenumber: 352
    old   9:  and (dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(:new_p.rowid)=&filenumber) THEN
    new   9:  and (dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(:new_p.rowid)=352) THEN

    Trigger created.

### Conclusion

To detect and prevent data corruption, perform the following Maximum
Availability Architecture (MAA) best practices:

- Use Oracle Data Guard.
- Set the Oracle Database block corruption detection parameters.
- Implement a backup and recovery strategy with Recovery Manager (RMAN).

These high availability solutions are integrated with Oracle Database and
take advantage of the underlying data structures. Thus, the tools offer a new
class of intelligent data protection and disaster recovery.
