One of the questions I get asked a lot by my customers is “How can I get the most out of my Office 365 subscription?” My answer is always “Start using Microsoft&reg; Teams!”

Improving collaboration and communication in the workplace is a challenge that all businesses struggle with. Many tools and applications exist that help improve how your organization adapts to the modern workplace, but Microsoft Teams can be a game changer for any business looking for a cloud-based solution. Whether your office has three employees or 3000, Microsoft Teams scales to meet your needs.

### What is Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams is a chat and collaboration workspace in Office 365 that aims to simplify group work. With Teams, it’s easy to share files and calendars, perform collaborative editing, and communicate with voice, video, and text chat.

Each Team has its own dedicated chat channel, which acts as the workplace hub for that team, allowing them to perform the following tasks:

- Share knowledge and keep it in the cloud with an integrated Wiki and OneNote Notebook dedicated to each team.
- Perform collaborative editing on files and store them in the cloud for your team to access.
- Integrate a whole host of external applications into a Teams channel such as Trello, GitHub, and Jira Cloud.
- Have a shared team calendar that integrates seamlessly into Outlook.
- Invite guest users from around the world to chat and collaborate with your team.

### Get started with Microsoft Teams

Most Office 365 subscriptions include Microsoft Teams, and you access it through your web browser, the desktop application, or even by using the mobile application. To get started with your first Team, select the **Teams** tab, click **Join or create a team**, and then choose **Build a team from scratch**.

As you follow the Team creation wizard, keep in mind your compliance and privacy needs. After you create your Team, add members in your organization to your team to start collaborating.

### The Microsoft Teams mobile application

One of my favorite features of Microsoft Teams is the mobile app. It’s a great way to ensure you stay connected to your team when you’re on the go. Missed the train and now you’re late to a crucial meeting? No sweat. Join via the Teams mobile app to make sure you won’t miss a beat. Perhaps you have a mobile work force and need to hold an emergency meeting? Your employees can video conference from anywhere in the world using only their mobile phone.
