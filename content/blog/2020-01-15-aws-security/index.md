### Introduction

(*Source*: [https://www.paramountassure.com/solutions/cloud-application-security](https://www.paramountassure.com/solutions/cloud-application-security))

Cloud computing security is a fast-growing service that provides many of the
same functionalities as traditional IT security. This includes protecting
critical information from theft, data leakage, and deletion.

One of the benefits of cloud services is that you can operate at scale and
remain secure. It is similar to how you currently manage security, but now you
have new ways of delivering security solutions that address new areas of
concern. Cloud security does not change the approach on how to manage security
from preventing to detective and corrective actions. However, it gives you the
ability to perform these activities in a more agile manner.

Your data is secured within data centers and where some countries require data
to be stored in their country. Choosing a provider that has multiple data
centers across the world can help to achieve this.

Data storage often includes certain compliance requirements, especially when
storing credit card numbers or health information. Many cloud providers offer
independent third-party audit reports to attest that their internal process
exist, and that they are effective in managing the security within their facilities where
you store your data.

The following image shows the three main cloud infrastructure principles:

### AWS cloud security components

AWS cloud security consists of the following components:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Inspector
- Certificate Manager
- Web Application Firewallâ€Š(WAF)
- Cloud Directory
- Key Management Service (KMS)
- Organizations
- Shield
- Macie
- GuardDuty

#### IAM

(*Source*: Unattributed)

IAM, a secure cloud security service, helps you to manage users, assign
policies, and form groups to manage multiple users.

AWS Identity Access Management allows you to do the following functions:

1) Establish access rules and permissions to specific users and applications.
2) Set up permissions for users and applications.
3) Create user groups for common rules assignment.
4) Use CloudTrail to monitor access.
5) Use Identity federation to log in with your company credentials.

(*Source*: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/iam-ug.pdf](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/iam-ug.pdf))

A principal is a person or application that requests an action or
operation on an AWS resource. When a principal tries to use the AWS Management
Console, the AWS Application Program Interface (API), or the AWS Command Line
Interface (CLI), that principal sends a request to AWS.

A principal must be authenticated (signed into AWS) by using their credentials to
send a request to AWS. AWS uses values from the request context to check for
policies that apply to the request. It then uses the policies to determine
whether to allow or deny the request. After AWS approves the operations in your
request, you can perform them on the related resources within your account.

#### Inspector

Inspector is an agent that you can install on your virtual machines, which
reports any security vulnerabilities.

(*Source*: [https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/))

Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve
the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector
automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations
from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces
a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity. These
findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment reports,
which are available through the Amazon Inspector console or API.

**Benefits:**

-	Integrates automated security checks into your regular deployment and
    production processes.
-	Finds application security issues.
-	Helps you gain a deeper understanding of your AWS resources.

#### Certificate Manager

(*Source*: [https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/))

AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage,
and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security
(SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected
resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and
establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on
private networks. AWS Certificate Manager removes the time-consuming manual
process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.

#### WAF

(*Source*: [https://aws.amazon.com/waf/](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/))

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from
common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise
security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over which
traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web
security rules. You can use AWS WAF to create custom rules that block common
attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that
are designed for your specific application. New rules can be deployed within
minutes, letting you respond quickly to changing traffic patterns. Also, WAF
includes a full-featured API that you can use to automate the creation,
deployment, and maintenance of web security rules.

**Benefits:**

-  Increases protection against web attacks.

-  Integrates security with application development.

-  Makes deployment and maintenance easy.

#### Cloud Directory

This service allows you to create flexible, cloud-native directories for
managing hierarchies of data along multiple dimensions.

(*Source*: [https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-directory/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-directory/))

AWS Cloud Directory enables you to build flexible cloud-native directories
for organizing hierarchies of data along multiple dimensions. With Cloud
Directory, you can create directories for a variety of use cases, such as
organizational charts, course catalogs, and device registries. While traditional
directory solutions, such as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services
and other LDAP-based directories, limit you to a single hierarchy, Cloud
Directory offers you the flexibility to create directories with hierarchies
that span multiple dimensions. For example, you can create an organizational
chart that can be navigated through separate hierarchies for reporting
structure, location, and cost center.

**Benefits**:

- Efficiently organize hierarchies of data across multiple dimensions.

- Scale automatically on managed infrastructure.

- Search your directory for objects and relationships.

- Easily adapt to changing data requirements.
