The following sections describe the five benefits you receive by transitioning
from Classic to Lightning.

#### Greater productivity

In mid-2018, Salesforce released a
[Forrester Consulting study](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/total-economic-impact-study-on-salesforce-lightning-shows-341-percent-return-on-investment-over-three-years-300661371.html)
that identified increased productivity as one of the greatest benefits of moving
to the Lightning experience. The study found that the combination of a newer
interface and forward-thinking tools like Salesforce Einstein made it easier for
users to accelerate existing processes.

In fact,
[the study revealed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/total-economic-impact-study-on-salesforce-lightning-shows-341-percent-return-on-investment-over-three-years-300661371.html)
IT departments that transitioned to Lightning increased measurable productivity
“by up to 25 percent and [has cut] time-to-market for applications nearly in half.”

#### Saved time and dollars

The Forrester study also showcased Salesforce Lightning’s ability to trim costs
and save valuable working hours. The 3-year economic impact study showed that
Salesforce Lightning could save “end users in sales organizations more than an
hour a week in productivity.” Moreover, because there is significantly less
turnover in developer roles, some organizations saved more than $165,000 in
hiring costs alone.

#### Third-party integrations and customizations

The Salesforce Lightning framework makes it easier than ever for developers to
create modern Salesforce apps. As a result, integration with various third-party
apps becomes much more accessible for administrators and developers.

Lightning also makes it possible to add custom components to the interface. These
customization options offer better opportunities for personalization than
Salesforce Classic.

#### Modernized user interface

The updated look and feel of Salesforce Lightning make it a user favorite. New
UI features were designed with key business teams in mind, as Salesforce created
an [intuitive and smart-thinking platform](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring16/release-notes/rn_lex.htm)
that “helps sales reps work more naturally and close more deals faster.”

What’s so special about the interface changes? At first glance, you’ll notice
things like easier-to-read text, icons, and graphics that provide a better
overall business snapshot. Updated dashboards give you improved visibility into
the metrics that matter most to your role so that you can grasp the big picture
for your teams and customers.

Ultimately, the convenience and ease of a streamlined interface make it easier
to foster user adoption of your platform.

#### Certainty for the future

Simply put, Salesforce Lightning is the way of the future. There is a great deal
of uncertainty about how long
[interface support for Salesforce Classic](https://tech.co/crm-software/salesforce-lightning-vs-classic-compared)
will be available. To avoid the risk of your organization being automatically
rolled over to Lightning at an unexpected time, be proactive and make a planned
switch.
