Rackspace Technology is aware of recently published security vulnerabilities impacting the Microsoft Windows Operating Systems. On February 14, 2023 Microsoft issued patches for 80 vulnerabilities, of which 9 are critical and 3 are actively exploited as 0-days.

**Rackspace engineers have performed an initial assessment and are advising customers to ensure February 2023 Windows Patches are installed as there are not any known software mitigations or workarounds for these vulnerabilities.** Rackspace customers using our Managed Patching Service will be patched during normal patching cycles.

For those customers not using Rackspace Managed Patching we recommend patching devices as soon as possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Customers not using our Managed Patching Service can install the latest Windows Updates themselves or can request that Rackspace perform patching by contacting Rackspace Support.

**Note - Reboot Issue with KB5022842 and Windows Server 2022 VMs on VMWare using Secure Boot**

It’s important to note there is a known issue with KB5022842 affecting Windows Server 2022 virtual machines on VMWare ESX vSphere ESXi 6.7 U2/U3 or vSphere ESXi 7.0.x. where, if SecureBoot is enabled for the virtual machine, the virtual machine will not boot up. VMWare and Microsoft are working to remediate the issue with an upcoming patch. Until a patch is released the following recommendations should be followed to avoid this issue.
- Upgrade the ESXi Hypervisor of the virtual machine to vSphere ESXi 8.0
- Disable "SecureBoot" on the VMs. 
- Avoid installing KB5022842 patch on any Windows 2022 Server virtual machine


In addition please note the following regarding remediation.
- Rolling back KB5022842 will not resolve booting issue.
