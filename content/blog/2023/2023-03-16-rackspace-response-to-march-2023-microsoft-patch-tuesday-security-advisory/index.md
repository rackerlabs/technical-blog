Rackspace Technology is aware that Microsoft recently published security vulnerabilities impacting Windows Operating Systems and other products. Microsoft issued patches for 83 vulnerabilities, of which 9 are critical and 2 are actively exploited as zero days. A full list of March 2023 Microsoft Patch Tuesday Security Advisories is available here: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2023-Mar.

Rackspace engineers have performed an initial assessment and strongly recommend that customers review the advisories and ensure appropriate patches are installed. Rackspace customers using our Managed Patching Service will be patched during normal patching cycles.

For those customers not using Rackspace Managed Patching, we recommend patching devices as soon as possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Customers not using our Managed Patching Service can install the latest Windows Updates themselves or can request that Rackspace perform patching by contacting Rackspace Support.

Additionally, SAP has published a list of SAP Security Patch Day – March 2023 vulnerabilities, located at https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html. SAP and Rackspace strongly recommend that customers who utilize SAP visit the Support Portal at [SAP Security Notes & News](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news.html) and apply patches to protect their SAP environment.

Our security teams are actively monitoring the situation and will provide any associated updates via this blog.
