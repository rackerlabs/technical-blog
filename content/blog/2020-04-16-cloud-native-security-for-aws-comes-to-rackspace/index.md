Amazon&reg; Web Services (AWS) has more native security products available than ever,
but many businesses lack the expertise to analyze and respond to this data quickly. Rackspace
is the first consulting managed security service provider (MSSP) to partner with AWS Security Hub.
The Rackspace Service Blocks for Cloud Native Security (CNS) integrates directly with the AWS Security Hub,
pulling threat information and alerts into your AWS environment.

<!--more-->
Certified security experts in the global Rackspace Security Operations Center (SOC)
offer you around-the-clock managed security services for three AWS security products:

- AWS Security Hub
- Amazon GuardDuty
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer

### Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that uses machine learning, anomaly detection,
and integrated threat intelligence to collect and aggregate account and network activities to identify
potential threats. Rackspace integrates and configures Amazon GuardDuty for your accounts and continuously
analyzes these findings. Certified security experts help you understand and respond to this information.

### AWS IAM Access Analyzer

AWS IAM Access Analyzer identifies resource-based policies that allow external access to your
environment. Rackspace monitors this information&mdash;validating any changes and addressing issues as necessary.

### AWS Security Hub

AWS Security Hub enables aggregation of findings from member accounts and other AWS security products, like GuardDuty and IAM Access Analyzer. It also provides full visibility to this information through an easy to understand interface. Rackspace CNS enables and configures AWS Security Hub for all your accounts and regions in scope.

### Benefits of Rackspace CNS

Rackspace CNS provides the following benefits:

- **Deployment and management**:  Rackspace deploys and configures supported AWS security tools into your AWS environment and provides ongoing management according to your business needs.
