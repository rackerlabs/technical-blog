It's fair to liken managing an enterprise IT department to conducting an
orchestra.

<!--more-->

A maestro ensures dozens of instruments with very different sounds (and most
likely very different personalities playing them) meld together precisely to
produce a beautiful symphony. In the same way, today's enterprise IT leader must
manage a wide array of geographically dispersed on-premises and
third-party IT platforms (with very different organizations providing very
different layers of support for each). All these execution venues must exchange
data with each other seamlessly so they can collectively deliver a cohesive
service quality for internal and external consumers alike. The major difference
between the conductor and the IT executive is that the latter is in concert
24/7/365.

### Less than ideal

The average enterprise currently uses at least
[five different multi-cloud](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/cloud-adoption-statistics/#gref)
platforms. A typical mix includes on-premises private clouds, colocation, hosted
private cloud, public cloud, and multiple Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings.
Data stored and processed in each must flow from one to the other rapidly and
securely. Over
[two-thirds of data traffic](https://www.darkreading.com/edge/theedge/a-beginners-guide-to-microsegmentation/b/d-id/1335849)
travels *east-west* between clouds, rather than *north-south* to the end user.
This flow of information is susceptible. If an adversary can make their way
into the east-west traffic, there's a good chance they could make their way
easily across the network and into all of your platforms.

Under normal circumstances, enterprises struggle to optimize and protect a
highly distributed network. Today, the response to the Coronavirus pandemic is
taking end users away from the secured office network core and into the far-edge
of their home offices. Thus, it's even more critical that east-west traffic
flowing between clouds is fast and protected, no matter the location. Also, the
reliance on additional cloud-based remote workplace services introduces new
endpoints that enterprises are scrambling to incorporate into their networking
strategies as quickly as possible.

To not only reduce the latency of data transfer to optimize performance, but
also to protect the flow of this information, enterprises typically built
private Wide Area Networks (WANs). The WANs spare a company's east-west traffic
from riding the public Internet, which introduces performance and security risks.
Traditionally, a company did this by locking itself into expensive point-to-point
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) connections with telecom carriers. They
had to procure separate connections for each platform. Fortunately, new
networking technology has paved the way for a significantly more cost-effective
and dynamic alternative.

### Solution

Enterprises can now turn to software-defined networking (SDN) platforms.  These
platforms have private physical links between the densest interconnectivity
hotspots and popular cloud and data center service providers. After they connect
to one of these networks, customers can spin up and down a multitude of virtual
connections over a single physical connection. Instead of managing multiple
point-to-point connections, SDN-powered platforms facilitate one-to-many
connections. So only one contract is needed to bring all platforms into a unified
private network. Also, unlike MPLS agreements, which require multiyear
commitments, virtual cross-connections typically require commitments as short
as one month.

Over the years, Rackspace has constructed a proprietary global dark fiber network
backbone that's completely independent of the public Internet that links major
metropolitan areas around the globe. We've also deployed routers along our
backbone within all of the Rackspace data centers, as well as data centers that
house the world's most robust network and cloud ecosystems. We also have extended
our backbone directly into several of the top public cloud providers' on-ramps
and the two leading SDN-powered interconnection platforms&mdash;Megaport
and the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabricâ€”in locations around the world. We call our
backbone an *ecosystem of ecosystems*. Not only can we spin up virtual connections
across each of the endpoints we've established, but we can also spin up virtual
connections across Megaport and Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric&mdash;all on the same
physical connection.

### More benefits

Any customers who use at least one Rackspace service can harness the power of
our ecosystem of ecosystems by leveraging RackConnect Global, our multi-cloud
connectivity offering.  Customers can take advantage of this service, whether
they deploy within a Rackspace data center or a third-party cloud that Rackspace
manages.

Considering the reach of our network, we can provide multiple pathways to connect
your Rackspace environment to each of the third-party platforms your company
uses across the world with private, low-latency virtual connections that bypass
the public Internet.

When you use RackConnect Global, you're not getting isolated one-to-one
connections between your Rackspace environment and each of the clouds in your
portfolio. We use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to create a cohesive virtual
environment that incorporates the data flow between each of your third-party
environments. For instance, let's say you have a Private Cloud residing in
the Rackspace Chicago data center and use RackConnect Global to spin up virtual
connections to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Northern Virginia and Alibaba Cloud
in Silicon Valley. The data flowing between Chicago and the two third-party
clouds rides the Rackspace backbone rather than the public Internet as does the
data flowing between AWS on the east coast and Alibaba on the west coast.

### Conclusion

If you're struggling to conduct your enterprise IT orchestra in a world where
your network perimeter is expanded in unforeseen ways with multiple clouds and a
distributed workforce, you have an option. Consider RackConnect Global to rapidly
optimize and secure the entirety of your network core in a fully-managed
fashion&mdash;a far more cost-effective solution than hiring multiple MPLS lines
from the telephone company.
