Rackspace Fanatical Support&reg; for AWS recently launched the enhancement of cost
optimization features in the Platform Essentials service block for North America
region customers.

<!--more-->

Weâ€™re excited to announce the expansion of Platform Essentials with
the Cost Optimizer on AWS feature set to the Europe, Middle East, and Asia (EMEA)
regions at the end of April. This product enhancement comes from the preexisting
Optimizer offer from Onica, a recently acquired Rackspace company. Rackspace
chose to acquire Onica partially because of the success of this product.

### Challenges

We hear from our customers all the time about the number of challenges, which
includes the following areas, when it comes to controlling costs in the public
cloud:

- **Knowledge and awareness**: AWS offers over 40,000 product stock keeping units
(SKUs) with dozens of pricing constructs. How can you stay on top of releases and
decide what is best for your company?

- **Ongoing improvements**: A single large negotiation, such as an AWS Enterprise
Discount Program (or EDP), does not ensure savings. How can you make sure you
realize new savings opportunities as your environment changes over time?

- **Business growth and sprawl**: As organizations grow, new business units and
cost centers emerge, all with their own spend and objectives. How can you keep
the organization on track to understand areas of spend and control costs?

We know that as more customers operate in the public cloud, we need to apply
more focus on cost optimization support. By including Cost Optimizer in Platform
Essentials, we guarantee that you receive an optimization focus in our most
basic, required service block.

Optimizer. This team stays hyper-focused on helping you understand your AWS

[CloudHealth](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/cloudhealth-for-fanatical-support-for-aws-release/)
with monthly spend breakdowns. These breakdowns help you visualize and

is available 24x7 to answer billing and cost-related questions as well as to
give guidance support on the underlying infrastructure.
