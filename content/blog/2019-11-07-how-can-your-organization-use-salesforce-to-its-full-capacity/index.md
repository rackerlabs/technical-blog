It is one thing to have access to Salesforce&reg; within your organization; it
is another be confident that you are using the platform to its full capacity.

What happens if you discover that your organization’s Salesforce usage is below
the curve? Don’t lose hope. It might take time to fully capitalize on the many
ways that Salesforce can empower your team. Here are four strategies to help you
develop a workable plan of action.

### Identify adoption benchmarks

To gauge the effectiveness of a tool or system, start by measuring user adoption.
How many employees actually use your Salesforce platform? How often? And how
fully? It is important to pick the appropriate benchmarks so you can define both
success and under-utilization. If you already devote time to selecting the right
metrics for measuring user adoption of your Salesforce platform, you are off to
a great start.

If you have not done so yet, here are some benchmarks to begin with.

#### User activity

The first metric to evaluate is the daily
[login activity of your Salesforce users](https://www.salesforce.org/measuring-adoption-is-your-crm-solution-healthy-and-growing/).
How often are people logging in? Are users regularly and reliably updating
contacts and records? Is the activity consistent with an individual’s role or
responsibilities? If login rates and engagement are low, you quickly identify
the root of the problem: your employees are not regularly using Salesforce.

[Salesforce Adoption Dashboards](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000004gHhLEAU)
provide a one-stop-shop for monitoring usage. Included in the app are 42
powerful reports for monitoring team member logins, key feature usage, as well
as how they update accounts and opportunities. Adoption Dashboards enable you
to take proactive steps to ensure organizational success.

#### Quality of data

Data quality is another important metric. Are team members accurately and
thoroughly completing critical fields? Can you trust others in your organization
to enter data responsibly according to Salesforce best practices? If your team
is off track, focus on the type and quality of data in your existing records.

The Field Trip app is a quick way to pull reports on Salesforce fields. Field
Trip analyzes fields in any object with optional filters for better reporting.
This app enables you to easily view the percentage of populated records and
gauge your organizational effectiveness.

#### Team productivity

It is nice to have a Salesforce guru on your team who understands the processes
and procedures and can execute them skillfully&mdash;but it takes more than one
Salesforce user to create profitability for the organization. Can all users move
beyond the basic data entry steps and contribute to the goals of the entire team?
Monitoring your team’s productivity levels might help identify pain points in
user adoption.

[Spinify: Lively Leaderboards](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000DqDQnUAN)
is one tool that can help track your team's productivity. The purpose of
Spinify&mdash;which has an impressive 5-star rating on the AppExchange&mdash;is
to develop team culture through engagement, motivation, and coaching. With
Spinify, you can identify high-performing team members without combing through
analytics. It also uses interactive features to inspire teams through positive
motivation.

#### Department-specific metrics

There are several more granular metrics you can use to measure Salesforce
adoption. These include numbers specific to
[sales, marketing, and service teams](https://www.mycustomer.com/selling/crm/crm-metrics-what-should-you-monitor-and-measure),
which you can design around the operations and needs of your organization.

Sales benchmarks include the number of new and retained customers, the amount
of revenue generated, and the sales cycle duration. For marketing, examine
revenue generated by each campaign, time spent per website visit, and online
user goal completion. Service benchmarks include the number of cases handled or
closed each day and complaint time to resolution.

### Recognize symptoms of under-utilization

After you develop a set of adoption benchmarks, the next step is to watch for
symptoms of under-utilization carefully. Some symptoms correlate directly to the
metrics you have already defined. If the adoption of your Salesforce platform is
low, stagnant, or in need of a revamp, you might notice:

- **Users entering data in multiple ways.** This might signal that there is a
  gap in your business process, or that users are struggling to understand the
  full capabilities of the platform.

- **A lack of engagement from company leadership.** While Salesforce offers
  plenty of analytical tools, they are not effective if management fails to
  actively monitor them. Pay special attention to how many members of your
  leadership team are using Salesforce regularly&mdash;they set the tone for
  user adoption throughout the rest of the company.

- **Leads and opportunities that do not change.** If team members are not updating
  leads and opportunities with new data, this suggests that your team might
  lack the motivation to incorporate the technology into their daily processes.

- **Low participation in Chatter.** If your organization has set a standard for
  activity in Chatter, take some time to evaluate whether users are actively
  contributing.

### See the signs of positive usage

Pinpointing symptoms of poor Salesforce adoption is essential to instigating a
plan for change. It is also equally important to identify what is working well.
Positive signs that your team is adequately using the platform’s functionality
might include:

- **A defined roadmap for Salesforce usage.** Confusion often stems from users
  who are unsure of the overall strategy. Teams thrive when management provides
  concrete goals and connects the capabilities of the technology to those goals.

- **Growing sales and closed deals.** When cases are moving forward, it usually
  signifies that your team members have a good grasp on how to use Salesforce
  data effectively.

- **Increased customer satisfaction.** While low levels of satisfaction can point
  to a disorganized system, high satisfaction levels generally indicate that an
  organization is using its customer success platform to improve customer
  engagement.

### Tips for increasing Salesforce adoption

Now that you have identified key metrics and symptoms to assess your current
Salesforce usage, you can craft a plan to encourage greater Salesforce adoption.
The following suggestions are especially useful for leaders to help their teams
acquire advanced Salesforce knowledge and skill.

- **Involve your team as early as possible.** If your organization is new to
  Salesforce, the switch from a previous system may not be quick. Get your team
  involved at the inception of the Salesforce project, provide them channels to
  give feedback, and listen to their concerns.

- **Provide ample training.** Successful adoption comes when users are
  well-equipped to use the software. Provide adequate training and set
  expectations from the start. Use refresher courses as needed to ensure your
  employees have the necessary support in learning to master the technology.

- **Clean and categorize data.** One of the motivations for implementing a
  customer success platform is to have accurate data available in real time. It
  is important to monitor the quality of data in Salesforce regularly&mdash;otherwise,
  it becomes a chore for your team to sift through disorganized and inaccurate
  data to leverage the information they need. As a result, they are more likely
  not to seek the data at all.

- **Create an engaging rewards system.** Along with monitoring for any issues,
  take time to recognize when team members go the extra mile to adopt features
  of the new platform. Use positive motivation to align all team members.

### Conclusion

When you set appropriate benchmarks, monitor signs of both struggle and success,
and integrate best practices for user adoption, you can get your teams using
Salesforce to its full capacity. You are then set to reap the rewards of using
this powerful solution to manage your data and strengthen your customer
relationships.
