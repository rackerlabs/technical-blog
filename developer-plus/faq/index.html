      <h3><a name="what_is" id="what_is"></a>What is the developer+ program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ is a program to introduce developers to Rackspace, the Rackspace Cloud, managed services,
        and Fanatical Support&reg; via developer-to-developer support. The program also helps developers to grow 
        with Rackspace and to experience, first hand, the Managed Cloud.</p>

      <p>Fundamentally, the developer+ program is an incubator for your idea. It provides an Infrastructure Credit,
        and period of time, so you can experience the full portfolio of Rackspace's cloud and build out
        your idea or business. Want to test out an MVP web application? You can do that. How about Experience
        CoreOS + Docker? You can do that as well (our CoreOS images are updated weekly). We want to
        provide you with what you need to build out modern applications on the world's largest OpenStack&trade;
        powered cloud.</p>

      <p>Participants in the developer+ program do not pay a Service Level Rate or Service level minimum.
        Instead, the program provides an infrastructure credit for 12 months that covers all Rackspace Cloud services.
        As with all Rackspace customers, participants in developer+ are provided the following services at
        no charge: Cloud DNS, Cloud Orchestration, Cloud Monitoring, Mailgun&trade; (first 50,000 emails free), and Cloud
        Networking. Some support options in the customer portal have been replaced for developer+ customers, such as
        one-to-one chat, support tickets, and the phone number. Tickets have been replaced with Billing Inquiries.</p>

      <p>As new products and services come online, they may be added to, and highlighted in, this program.</p>

      <p>Additionally, developer+ includes several direct feedback mechanisms (as part of the terms and conditions of
        signup) that allow our teams to get direct, honest feedback from customers. This is key to the development of
        the program.</p>

      <p>For additional information, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-developer-program-for-developers-by-developers">the
        official announcement</p>.

      <p>The Infrastructure credit is at this time $50 (30 GBP) per month for 12 months.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="limited" id="limited"></a>Are the services rate limited?</h3>

      <p>No, any rate limits that apply are our documented default service limits for all Rackspace customers.
        We have not throttled, crippled, or otherwise made this a technically-inferior program for developers.</p>

      <p>You have complete access to all services and features.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="identified" id="identified"></a>How is developer+ identified in the different Service Levels?</h3>

      <p>Customers in the developer+ program are a part of the Managed Infrastructure service level, but developer+ customers 
        have limited access to phone and chat resources. They also have a customized self-service view within the control panel.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we offer Developer-to-Developer online support, which is delivered to developers in a way they
        are used to and expect. Developer-to-Developer differs from online support only in scope and location, and it 
        remains the exceptional customer experience, backed by the Fanatical Support, that customers expect from Rackspace.</p>

      <p>The following features are part of developer+:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An enriched developer portal, developer guides, and a continually improved developer experience based on
          direct feedback
        </li>
        <li>Rackspace Developer-to-Developer and troubleshooting support from our experts to help you leverage our
          interfaces (APIs and SDKs) in your code
        </li>
        <li>IRC (#rackspace on irc.freenode.net)</li>
        <li>StackOverflow Community Forums, email, Hacker News, and other online communities<br><strong>Note:</strong>
          Tickets filed are limited to billing inquires only.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="add_service" id="add_service"></a>What if developers want to add another server? Test a website or
        database?</h3>

      <p>developer+ customers can consume cloud at a "pay for what you consume" competitive prices for all services
        in any region. They can consume ObjectRocket&trade;, OnMetal&trade;, and everything else currently
        available to our other customers.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="upgrade" id="upgrade"></a>Can developer+ participants upgrade to another service level?</h3>

      <p>At any time, participants in the program may log into the Control Panel and upgrade to our Managed Cloud
        service levels. Customers may not, however, switch to developer+.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="existing" id="existing"></a>Can existing customers have their accounts moved to developer+?</h3>

      <p>Not at this time. Only new accounts can choose the developer+ program.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="billing" id="billing"></a>How are developer+ customers billed?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ pay only for infrastructure they consume over $50 (30 GBP) per month for 12 months.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="expiration" id="expiration"></a>What happens at the end of 12 months?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ will be contacted prior to the 12 month term completion to discuss upgrading to
        the Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations service levels. By default, at the end of 12 months
        the Managed Infrastructure level will be applied including Service Level rates.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="slas" id="slas"></a>Are developer+ customers eligible for the SLA guarantees covered by Managed
        Infrastructure?</h3>

      <p>Yes, but their credit is reduced by 50 percent as noted in the Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="difference" id="difference"></a>What is the difference between developer+ and the Startup Program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ offers a way for developers who are comfortable writing and deploying their code, and require
        minimal assistance, to use the Rackspace Cloud. </p>

      <p>The Rackspace Startup Program offers discounted infrastructure as a service, and it leverages Rackspace’s
        knowledge and experience in the business and technology communities to offer developing companies advice on
        how to best architect their product. The Startup Program also connects entrepreneurs to tools like
        ObjectRocket&trade; and Mailgun&trade;, and the program gives them access to guidance on their startup through our 
        extensive network of startup and technology business professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
