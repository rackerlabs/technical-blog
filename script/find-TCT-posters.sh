# Purpose: Identify all *md files in content/blog where:
# The blog is published in the specified year
#
# Example call: find-TCT-posters.sh 2020
#
# NOTE: Script assumes you are executing from within the script directory of
#       your local blog git repo.
#
# Process:
# 1) Get the dates to compare from the arguments passed in
# 2) Get the list of TCT Rackers
# 3) Go to blog repo content directory (assumption: you are in the script dir)
# 3) Use for loop to go through all *md files in each content sub dir
#    and list all file names and directories where:
#       last_modified_date is between begin and end dates (from the script arguments)
#
# Updates:
#


# assign date arguments to variables
