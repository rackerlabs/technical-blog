Portland is known for quite a few things, great food, street artists, and of course plenty of breweries. This week Portland will be home to [OSCON](http://oscon.com), a gathering of all things open source. Come to OSCON to learn about the latest open source technologies and how best to utilize them.

[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) has been an advocate of open source technology for many years. We worked with NASA three years ago to create an open source cloud, [OpenStack](http://openstack.org), which has taken the world by storm.  The impact that OpenStack has had on the world is massive. Some well known companies including Best Buy, Comcast and Bloomberg are all using OpenStack due to its open nature and the community around it. These companies spoke at the [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/session-videos/presentation/keynote-openstack-as-a-platform-ecosystem).<!-- more -->

Rackspace has been active in the open source community, just in the last few months we've open sourced many projects, including

* [Marconi](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi)
* [Cloud Cafe](https://github.com/stackforge/cloudcafe)
* [Melange](https://github.com/rackerlabs/melange)
* [Yagi](https://github.com/rackerlabs/yagi)

Come to the Rackspace booth in Hall D #507 to talk about how open source is being used to provide great solutions for dedicated servers, public and private clouds and hybrid cloud! While at the booth pick up a t-shirt and enter to win some Game of Thrones swag.

###Speaking Events###

####Everett Toews: Monday 7:00PM Room D137 [jclouds:Control Multi-Cloud Infrastructure With Java](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/31451)

In this BoF Everett will introduce you to Apache jclouds and what it can do for you.

jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and utilizes your Java or Clojure development skills. The jclouds API gives you the freedom to use portable abstractions or cloud-specific features. It's a multi-cloud toolkit that works with both public and private clouds, enabling hybrid cloud workloads.

There is a great community behind this toolkit working together to provide a better experience for developers in the cloud. Their goal is to simplify the control of many different clouds while still giving you the freedom to use cloud-specific features. The result is a toolkit that allows developers to write better code, in a shorter period of time, that works with the many supported clouds.

Once the introduction is finished, we can discuss any topics from novice to expert. Everett is a committer on jclouds and will do his best to answer any questions you might have!

####Everett Toews: Wednesday 11:30AM Room E143 [Cloud Portability With Multi-Cloud Toolkits](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/31432)

It’s a multi-cloud world but your code needs to run somewhere. However, the cloud you choose today may not be the cloud you need tomorrow. Changes in reliability, performance, cost, and privacy may drive you to research alternative public clouds, a private cloud, or a hybrid of the two.

Considering cloud portability upfront can be crucial in avoiding lock-in. The tools you use to interact with the cloud will play a large part in how portable your code is between clouds.

In this session you'll learn how to effectively use software development toolkits that operate across multiple clouds. Find out how to distinguish between the layers of abstraction to achieve maximum portability or utilize cloud specific features. Everett will show examples of multi-cloud toolkit code for Java (jclouds), Node.js (pkgcloud), Python (libcloud), and Ruby (fog).

####Shane Duan: Monday 7:00PM Room D139 - So You Want to Collect lots of Metrics? Come check out Rackspace's new open source project Blueflood.

Rackspace engineers built a metrics system to process, store and serve 8 million data points per hour. We’re pleased to announce its launch as the Blueflood open source project.
We will discuss the first release of Blueflood in this BoF and show how developers can gather and make use of a large number of metrics. Learn how to make use of diagnostic data and see how Rackspace has used the tool to generate value. Software engineers are welcome to discuss the roadmap for development of this newly open source tool.

####Wayne Walls & Alex Brandt: Tuesday 9:00AM Room E142 - "Butter" Up Your Application!

Learn how public, private and hybrid clouds can be leveraged to your advantage to free your application(s) from a one-size-fits-all cloud in favor of one that is a perfect fit.
As an added bonus, during this session the Rackspace [Unlocked](http://unlocked.io) team will open-source a new cloud application named "Margarine." We will drill into the data design, the technologies used, the decision making process and how the Pillars of Cloudiness were applied to the entire application. Building applications on the Rackspace Cloud has never been easier and we look forward to showing you how we can give your applications a perfect home.

####Niki Acosta: Wednesday 3:25PM & Thursday 1:40PM OpenStack Pavilion - Breaking Glass for Fun and Profit.

We'll be available to answer any questions you may have.  Please stop by our booth and say hi!
