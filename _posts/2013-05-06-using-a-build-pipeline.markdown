As [discussed previously](http://devops.rackspace.com/the-new-devops-blog.html), this blog is hosted entirely in [Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/). It is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org), which means it is static - perfect for hosting in an object store. Our "architecture" looks like this:

Previously, deploying the blog was a one-and-done job. A single Jenkins job that upon a push to GitHub, would install our Ruby gems, install the theme, generate the site, and push the site to Cloud Files. This worked well, for a while. Then Murphy got involved.<!--More-->

##If anything can go wrong...

Using a single Jenkins job to perform multiple tasks is not ideal. This is especially true when you don't perform error checking in your scripts. Jenkins isn't smart enough on it's own to know that step three of your five step process was a failure and it should probably stop working.

Rake tasks would fail on the install of the theme, or installs of gems, or even generating the site. Problems arose when Jenkins would sync those failures to our public cloud files container. Since nothing would be there to sync, Jenkins would sync nothing - taking the site down in the process and giving you the reader a very bland 404 page. On top of that, I'd get an email from [Cloud Monitoring](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/monitoring/) plus a few more from Rackers wondering if the site was down on purpose (Hint: it's never down on purpose).

##That sounds... irresponsible.

Yes. It was horribly irresponsible... to leave it that way. Recently I have implemented a build pipeline using several plugins from Jenkins:

* [Build Pipeline Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-pipeline-plugin) - This plugin renders upstream and downstream connected jobs that typically form a build pipeline. In addition, it offers the ability to define manual triggers for jobs that require intervention prior to execution, e.g. an approval process outside of Jenkins.
* [Clone Workspace SCM Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Clone+Workspace+SCM+Plugin) - This plugin makes it possible to archive the workspace from builds of one project and reuse them as the SCM source for another project.

Using these two together allows me to split each task into its own job. Now our build pipeline looks like this:

As you can see, some jobs are successful, some jobs fail, but NOTHING gets pushed to Cloud Files without passing through each gate successfully. This also allows me to run reporting at each step in parallel to the build task. Check out the above plugins for your Jenkins jobs and **get more modular**.
