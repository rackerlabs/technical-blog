Rackspace will be all over the [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/) in Portland next week. We're so excited about so many things during the Summit! First of all, if you’ve contributed code to the OpenStack project, we want to offer you **free hosting**. Go over to [iopenedthecloud.com](http://iopenedthecloud.com) during the Summit, or stop by the Rackspace booth (booth A5) for more info. You made the code free; we’ll make your cloud free – **up to $500 per month for two years**. You can verify contributions at [http://www.ohloh.net/](http://www.ohloh.net/). I'll be at the booth and I'd love to give some free hosting away. <!--More-->

We also have tons of speaking sessions given by Rackspace experts throughout the Summit. You may remember Troy Toman's keynote on Rackspace's use of OpenStack from the last Summit in San Diego:

This time around we are partnering with a customer, [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/), to showcase how they use OpenStack with Rackspace.

For a complete listing of all the things Rackspace at the Summit, keep an eye on the Rackspace [OpenStack Summit Guide](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/openstack-portland/). I'll be posting daily recaps here all week on the DevOps Blog.
