As part of our ongoing mission to serve developers, we are proud to announce the initial public release of [Gophercloud](https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/). Gophercloud is a [Go](http://golang.org) OpenStack&trade;-first SDK with Rackspace support. What that means is Rackspace and OpenStack&trade; users can seamlessly integrate it into their existing applications, and users of other Openstack-based clouds can extend it to work with theirs.

Of note: This release represents a major version increment and ships with an API that will break previous versions. Gophercloud 0.1.0 was an exploratory release, and we've taken this opportunity to incorporate the feedback we received and ship something that we'll be able to support and extend for a long time to come. For better robustness, consistency and reliability, though, we strongly recommend adopting a client-side [dependency management system](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/PackageManagementTools) like godep.

Initially Gophercloud supports the following services:

 - Compute
 - Object Storage
 - Networking
 - Block Storage
 - Identity

And more [on the way](https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/pulls).

To install Gophercloud, first set the $GOPATH environment variable to the root of your Go workspace:

```
 mkdir $HOME/go
 export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```
After that, you can install it with the following command:

```
 go get github.com/rackspace/gophercloud
```

From there on, you can follow the [getting started guides](https://gophercloud.io/docs/) to help you get up and running.

If you'd like to use the previous version of Gophercloud, you can find it [here](https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/tree/release/v0.1.1). After following the steps above, move into the gophercloud directory and run
```
git checkout release/v0.1.1
```
Now you will be using the Gophercloud v0.1.1 release and can store this state with a client-side package manager.

As with any of our other SDKs, you can always reach us via chat (#rackspace channel on Freenode IRC) if you have any issues, questions or suggestions.
