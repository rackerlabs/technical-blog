title: Send emails using Mailgun from your Capistrano recipes

The guys over at Mailgun just posted an overview of how to use Mailgun to power email notifications from your Capistrano recipes. We've got a lot of customers using Capistrano to automate their big web deployments, so we thought we'd share a summary. You can read the full post on the [Mailgun blog](http://blog.mailgun.net/post/34575771416/using-mailgun-with-capistrano-recipes).

If you're using Capistrano, you can use this code, written by Spike Grobstein, Mailgun customer and Senior DevOps Engineer at [Ticket Evolution](http://ticketevolution.com/), to automatically send a notification after deployment ([here's the Github code](https://github.com/spikegrobstein/capistrano-mailgun)). Just add the following to your deploy.rb file:

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
set :mailgun_api_key, 'key-12345678901234567890123456789012' # your mailgun API key
set :mailgun_domain, 'example.com' # your mailgun email domain
set :mailgun_from, 'deployment@example.com' # who the email will appear to come from
set :mailgun_recipients, [ 'you@example.com', 'otherguy@example.com' ] # who will receive the email

# create an after deploy hook
after :deploy, 'mailgun_notify'{% endcodeblock %}

That's it. When you deploy, it should automatically send an email using the built-in text and HTML templates. You can also send emails that include more sophisticated variables, create different notification emails for different mailing lists (e.g. developers@awesomesauce.com or qa@awesomesauce.com) or customize the emails. [Grab that code on Github](https://github.com/spikegrobstein/capistrano-mailgun).

I hope this makes managing epic deployments a little easier for you!
