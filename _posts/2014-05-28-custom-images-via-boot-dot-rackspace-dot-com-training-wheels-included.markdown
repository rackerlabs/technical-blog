With the recent announcement of
[Cloud Images](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/images/), creating custom images
for the [Rackspace Public Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers)
is now a functionality users have at their disposal.

To simplify the custom image creation process, Rackspace released
[boot.rackspace.com](http://boot.rackspace.com), a collection of iPXE scripts
that allows you to rapidly network boot Operating Systems, Utilities and other
tools very easily. It's especially useful for remote access environments when
you don't want to utilize remote attached CD's in a Dell DRAC, HP iLO or some other
type of remote tool. It's especially awesome for bootstrapping your own custom
installation on a Cloud Server!
<!-- more -->
In this post, I will walk you through each of the steps required to get you up &
running a custom version of __Ubuntu 12.04__ via boot.rackspace.com.

## Assumptions

* An existing [Public Cloud](http://mycloud.rackspace.com) account
* [python-novaclient](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-python-novaclient-on-linux-and-mac-os) is installed

## Notes
* Versions of Ubuntu greater than 12.04 have not been thorougly tested with this tutorial.
  Therefore, it is recommended you too use Ubuntu 12.04.

## How-To Steps
__1. Boot the boot.rackspace.com ISO__

This command will boot a Cloud Server with a small 1 MB iPXE based ISO. In turn, it
will set up the server’s assigned networking within the virtual BIOS and
netboot into a menu of operating system options hosted over HTTP on
boot.rackspace.com.

```
nova boot --image=9aa0d346-c06f-4652-bbb1-4342a7d2d017 --flavor=performance1-2 my_ubuntu_1204
```

__2. Connect to the boot.rackspace.com VM via the Console__

* Log into [mycloud.rackspace.com](http://mycloud.rackspace.com)
* Once the VM is 'Active,' click on the 'Actions' available in the Server
  Details, and select 'Connect Via Console'

{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/connect_via_console.png %}

__2. Select Linux Operating Systems from the Boot Menu__
{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/menu.png %}

__3. Select Ubuntu from the list of Distros__
{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/distro.png %}

__4. Select 12.04 from the list of Versions__
{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/version.png %}

__5. Select ubuntu install from the the Boot Paramaters__
{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/params.png %}

__6. Proceed through the install & setup accordingly__

* In addendum to custom modifications, make sure to do the following:
    * During partioning:
        * Select 'Guided - use entire disk'
        * Use the 'Virtual disk 1 (xvda) - 42.9 GB`
    * Select OpenSSH server during the software install process
    * Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record

{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/install.png %}

__7. Reboot from local hdd__

Once the installation is complete, the VM will reboot and the console will
disconnect. Reconnect to the console, but this time, select to boot
from the Local HDD as we've already installed the OS and because iPXE by
default does a netboot.

__8. Instance configuration required by Rackspace__

To configure the instance, you must first get to the prompt. You can do
this via the console from the browser, or by SSH'ing into the VM (SSH may be easier to work
with)

{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/os_console.png %}

Install curl

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl -y
```

Now proceed to install XenServer Tools & Nova Agent

* XenServer Tools
    * The XenTools are needed for communication between the host and the guest
      for configuration via the xenstore

```
curl -skS -L http://git.io/nUeUrA | sudo bash
```

* Nova Agent
    * The Nova Agent is used for configuration of the instance. It handles
      detection of the Operating System type and sets the appropriate
      networking configuration. It also handles password resets, configuration
      of any licensing for Red Hat and Windows, versioning, and the ability to
      handle updates of itself

```
curl -skS -L http://git.io/_tdvZw | sudo bash
```

* Clear out the network interfaces

```
(cat | sudo tee /etc/network/interfaces) << EOF
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
EOF
```

__9. Make custom OS modifications__

This is the opportunity to install, configure and set up any custom system level
modifications you want to persist for future instances of the image

__10. Once modifications are complete, cleanup your image__

* Typically, you'll want to remove the following before taking the snapshot
to have a clean, pristine image:
    * local files in root & other user home directories
    * log files
    * history
    * ssh_host keys
    * unnecessary files
    * etc.

__11. After modifications and cleanup is done, snapshot your image__

In the Server Details, select 'Create Image' to snapshot the image as-is and
give it a name, i.e. 'my_ubuntu_1204'

{% img custom-images-via-boot-dot-rackspace-dot-com-training-wheels-included/create_image.png %}

__12. Set metadata for the image__

* Set vm_mode to:
    * "xen" for a Paravirtualized (PV) Instance. For most Linux VMs, PV is typically
    the best option.
    * "hvm" for HVM Mode, typically used for FreeBSD, Linux PVHVM and Windows. When
    using with Linux, make sure you're using one of the newer 3.x kernels for the
    best experience.

* If using Nova Agent:
    * Set xenapi_use_agent=true

* If using Cloud-Init exclusively, the Agent isn't needed, so make sure to
disable it so that the build isn't actively polling for responses from the Nova
Agent:
    * set xenapi_use_agent=false

```
nova image-meta my_ubuntu_1204 set vm_mode=xen
nova image-meta my_ubuntu_1204 set xenapi_use_agent=true
```

__13. After snapshotting, its time to boot your custom image__

```
nova boot --image="my_ubuntu_1204" --flavor=performance1-2 my_ubuntu_1204_test
```

__14. Log in to the VM via console and/or SSH & enjoy your new custom image \:)__

## Notes
* Once you save/snapshot your custom image, you __must__ use a Performance Flavor
  to boot the VM
* After snapshotting & testing the boot of the custom image, it is safe to
  delete the initial boot.rackspace.com ISO VM
