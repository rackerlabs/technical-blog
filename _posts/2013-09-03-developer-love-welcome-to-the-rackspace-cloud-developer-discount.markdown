It's time to go make something awesome, on us.

Developers, hackers, devops people and makers of the digital age - you are
the engines of the tech world. Each day you put your imagination and skills
to work to build amazing things.

*Today we're pleased to offer a new **$300 over six months** Developer
Discount program in the US and UK.*

<!-- more -->

Sign up for a **new** Rackspace Cloud account in the US or UK at
[developer.rackspace.com/devtrial][8], and your account is automatically
credited $50 (£30 UK) for 6 months. You're responsible for anything above
$50, otherwise: it's on us.

Maybe you're building the next [SaltStack][9] or [Ansible][10]. We welcome
you. Or perhaps you're planning a beautiful abstraction like [Docker][11], a
sharing platform, or an encrypted communications service--we're here to help.
Or maybe you just want to add support for [OpenStack][1] to your cloud based
tool or project. This is a thank you.

The Developer Discount program makes it easy for you to chase something you
feel passionate about and simply need a place to build and deploy it.
Regardless of what you make, or want to make, we celebrate and encourage your
creativity. That's why Rackspace is dedicated to making developer lives easier.
It's what keeps us passionate about supporting collaborative open source
projects and communities.

Explore what you can do on the world's largest open-source, [OpenStack][1]
based cloud. Give us your feedback on our array of open source,
[multi-cloud tools][2].

Give [vagrant-rackspace][3] a spin, or try out [rumm][4] - a powerful little
command line tool. Explore our open source tools and projects (check out
[github.com/rackspace][6] and [github.com/rackerlabs][5]). We look forward to
hearing your thoughts and feedback.

Call, [email][7] or join us on IRC (irc.freenode.net, #rackspace).

Go forth and make something awesome. Talk about it; blog about it - put it
on Github and share it with the world. Remember - we
[respect you and your data][12] and we will always support you.
