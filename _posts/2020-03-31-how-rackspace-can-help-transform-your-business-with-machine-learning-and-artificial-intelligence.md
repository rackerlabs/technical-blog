## AI/ML assessment and strategy

Rackspace helps you to visualize how AI/ML can improve your business, then works with you to develop a practical
solution that focuses on technology and business transformation. At the end of this process you receive a defined
business use case, a proposed AI/ML solution definition and scope, and a technical roadmap for implementation.
The AI/ML assessment and strategy solution includes:

- **AI/ML Workshop:** Rackspace data architects and scientists conducts an on-site workshop to discuss how businesses similar
to yours are currently leveraging data and AI/ML, ideate solutions for high-priority use cases, and decide whether a
proof-of-concept or prototype is necessary.

- **AI/ML Strategy:** Rackspace spends 2&mdash;4 weeks prioritizing use cases according to business needs and solution
complexity, assessing your current data platform, defining a high-level architecture, and conducting an initial long-range
planning (LRP) session to define the implementation roadmap.


### AI transformation

Rackspace helps you leverage AI/ML by using best practices to implement a prototype or proof-of-concept AI/ML solution
for your data. Rackspace can also immediately begin working if you are ready for a full production solution, including
data infrastructure and AI/ML model development and deployment. This feature also helps facilitate process documentation
and knowledge transfer. The AI transformation solution includes:

- **AI/ML solution architecture and design:** Rackspace reviews the customer’s use case, data quality, and existing data
infrastructure and uses it to design an enterprise-grade production AI/ML solution.

- **Data Integration:** Rackspace develops an overall data lake and data pipeline strategy and builds a large,
high-quality training dataset that includes data ingestion, data preparation, data segregation and pipeline automation.

- **Model Development and Implementation:** Rackspace implements the end-to-end AI/ML solution. This includes feature engineering,
 model development and training, testing and validation, and model deployment and monitoring.
