One of my favorite services here at Rackspace is [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com), a set of APIs that allow you to send email and manage mailing lists via a REST API. Coming back from a recent trip to San Antonio I decided that I would add an Objective-C interface to send email via Mailgun using my own iOS interface instead of using Apple's `MFMailComposeViewController`. This library is now [open sourced on Github](https://github.com/rackerlabs/objc-mailgun) and available via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org).<!-- more -->

##Installing

To install the Mailgun SDK, you can either use the fantastic [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) or install directly from the source by adding the `Mailgun.(h|m)` and `MGMessage.(h|m)` to your Xcode project. If you choose to install manually you will also need to follow the instructions to install the [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/wiki/Getting-Started-with-AFNetworking) library.

##Using the Mailgun SDK

Currently the only functions of the Mailgun API the SDK supports are sending e-mail, subscribing to mailing lists and unsubscribing to mailing lists. I felt that these are the most common features an app developer would use but more features of the Mailgun API will be added in the future. Full Documentation for the library can be found in the [Docs directory on Github](https://github.com/rackerlabs/objc-mailgun/tree/master/Docs) or on [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org).

##Sending a Message

To quickly send a message via the Mailgun SDK, we'll create our client using the Class method `clientWithDomain:apiKey:` the arguments to this method being your specific Mailgun domain and API key. For this example we will be using `samples.mailgun.org` and `key-3ax6xnjp29jd6fds4gc373sgvjxteol0`.

    Mailgun *mailgun = [Mailgun clientWithDomain:@"samples.mailgun.org" apiKey:@"key-3ax6xnjp29jd6fds4gc373sgvjxteol0"];

Message sending can happen in several ways. You can use the instance method `sendMessageTo:from:subject:body` to quickly fire off a simple, "one off" message like so:

    [mailgun sendMessageTo:@"Jay Baird <jay.baird@rackspace.com>" 
                      from:@"Excited User <someone@sample.org>" 
                   subject:@"Mailgun is awesome!" 
                      body:@"A unicode snowman for you! ☃"];

You can also construct a more featureful message using the `MGMessage` object. Here I'll create an `MGMessage` object with an image attachment of a cat, because the Internet exists solely to proliferate pictures of cats, and send it via the SDK:

    UIImage *catImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"cat-pic-01"];
    MGMessage *message = [MGMessage messageFrom:@"Excited User <someone@sample.org>"
                                             to:@"Jay Baird <jay.baird@rackspace.com>"
                                        subject:@"Mailgun is awesome!"
                                           body:@"Mailgun is great, here is a picture of a cat."];
    [message addImage:catImage withName:@"cat-pic-01" type:PNGFileType];

This attaches a `UIImage` to the `MGMessage` I created. The data from the `UIImage` will be added as an attachment to the message. 

*An identical interface exists for OS X that takes an `NSImage` and a `NSBitmapImageFileType`.*

Once our message is constructed we can add recipients via the `addRecipient:` method, add CC and BCC recipients via `addCC:` and `addBCC:` and also add [tags](http://documentation.mailgun.net/user_manual.html#tagging), variables and a whole host of other features supported by the [Mailgun API](http://documentation.mailgun.net/user_manual.html#sending-messages). [Take a look at the header](https://github.com/rackerlabs/objc-mailgun/blob/master/Classes/MGMessage.h) of `MGMessage.h` to see all that is supported. 

To send this specially constructed message you can use the client methods `sendMessage:` or the block-based callback method `sendMessage:success:failure:`. Here we'll use the latter to show the user a message when the `MGMessage` is successfully sent or display an error if there was an error.

    [mailgun sendMessage:message success:^(NSString *messageId) {
        NSLog(@"Message %@ sent successfully!", messageId);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"Error sending message. The error was: %@", [error userInfo]);
    }];

##Subscribing/Unsubscribing to Mailing Lists

Mailgun's mailing lists provide a convenient way to send to multiple recipients by using an alias email address. Mailgun sends a copy of the message sent to the alias address to each subscribed member of the mailing list. Adding a subscribe/unsubscribe feature to your app can be a great way to stay engaged and in touch with your customers by sending them periodic updates and tips. To subscribe a user to a mailing list, we'll use the same Mailgun client we created in the first example:

    Mailgun *mailgun = [Mailgun clientWithDomain:@"samples.mailgun.org" apiKey:@"key-3ax6xnjp29jd6fds4gc373sgvjxteol0"];

For this example, I have created an `AboutViewController` that has a `UITextField` where a user can enter their email address and tap a subscribe button. Here's how I handle the subscribe button's action:

    UITextField *mailTextField = [[UITextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];

    [mailgun subscribeToList:@"news@sampleapp.org" email:mailTextField.text success:^{
        NSLog(@"Successfully subscribed user to mailing list!");
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"There was an error while subscribing to the mailing list: %@", [error userInfo]);
    }];

The success and failure blocks can be used to display more information to the user, track analytics and show/dismiss progress while the SDK is making the necessary API calls.

To unsubscribe the process is similar. We take the email of a subscribed user, in this case we'll use my email address `jay.baird@rackspace.com` and unsubscribe from the SampleApp mailing list:

    NSString *emailAddress = @"jay.baird@rackspace.com";
    [mailgun unsubscribeToList:@"news@sampleapp.org" email:emailAddress success:^{
        NSLog(@"Successfully removed %@ from the mailing list", emailAddress);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"Error removing address from mailing list: %@", [error userInfo]);
    }];

**NOTE**: If a user is not subscribed to a mailing list this method will call the failure block with a 404 error. This is normal and should be handled appropriately.

I hope this brief introduction to the new Mailgun SDK gets you as excited as I am to add Mailgun features to your next OS X or iOS project. Feel free to fork the project and contribute or file any issues you find on our [Github page](https://github.com/rackerlabs/objc-mailgun).
