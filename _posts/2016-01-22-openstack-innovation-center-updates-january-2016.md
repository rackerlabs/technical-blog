Since the initial launch of the OpenStack Innovation Center back in July of 2015 much work has been done.  Wanted to take a moment to share the current status and some details about its next phases.  If you are unfamiliar with OSIC let me start off with some very quick background information.

<!-- more -->

The OpenStack Innovation Center, abbreviated to ‘OSIC’, is a join partnership between Rackspace and Intel to further accelerate the development of enterprise capabilities into upstream OpenStack code.  It is intended to bring together Rackspace and Intel engineers in order to: 

>***“advance the scalability, manageability and reliability of OpenStack by adding new features, functionality and eliminating bugs through upstream code contributions”*** 

as mentioned in the [Rackspace press release](https://blog.rackspace.com/newsarticles/rackspace-collaborates-with-intel-to-accelerate-openstack-enterprise-feature-development-and-adoption/).

It is also intended to offer the greater OpenStack community with an OpenStack cloud at an enterprise scale in order to develop/test that new OpenStack functionality.  The OSIC hub can be found within Rackspace’s corporate headquarters in San Antonio, TX nicknamed “Castle”. Personally the OSIC launch was a very exciting one since it was aimed at solving some of OpenStack’s greatest challenges thus far, which are enterprise focused features and the basic idea that OpenStack was not enterprise ready.  Those two 1,000 node OpenStack clusters sort of dispel that second wrong idea in so many ways.  OpenStack runs in my blood and I am very proud to be part of the community.

OK, enough of my banter and lets get down to business with some updates!

**Innovation Center**

Yes, you can actually see, touch and sit in it now.  The Innovation Center located at Rackspace’s Castle launched on September 10th of 2015.  Imagine reserving a whole wing of what used to be a old shopping mall just to seat a bunch of OpenStack developers, engineers, support and architect staff.  This is the location where Rackspace and Intel engineers can collaborate on all things OpenStack.  We openly invite any and all who are interested to come on down to see it with there own eyes.

**Developer Training/Joint OpenStack Engineering**

As of October 2015 Intel has placed ~12 developers into the Innovation Center to take part in the detailed training program created in order to on-board OpenStack focused developers.  From that point forward roughly 10-15 additional developers will be brought in to work in the Innovation Center on a monthly basis.  The details around the OSIC engineering road map can be found in the below slide from the Tokyo OpenStack Summit:

**Developer Cloud**

Come on...you know you only read this far to get the scope on this section.  Being honest, the Developer Cloud is pretty darn cool and I can not blame you.  Just saying “two 1000-node OpenStack clusters” out loud sounds impressive.  As an architect my first thought was “show me the details!”.  Well you will be the first to get a look at the details that make up the first of the 1000-node cluster that is hosted at the Rackspace Dallas Fort Worth datacenter.  Could not think of a better combination of being funded by Intel and supported by Rackspace.
 
Keep in mind the below details encompass only the first 1000-node cluster that is ready for use and hosted at Rackspace.  Unfortunately, I was not able to get any exciting details on the second cluster located at Intel in Oakland, California yet.  Keep posted for more updates to come at a later date.  Before we jump in I want to thank my fellow Racker, ***James Thorne ([@jameswthorne](https://twitter.com/jameswthorne))***, for providing the cloud details.  He is our resident keeper and protector of the Rackspace hosted OpenStack Developer cloud.

***OSIC Cluster @ Rackspace***

* Made up of ~1012 bare metal servers that are broken up in particular ways to server the various requests that come in from the OpenStack community.
* Over 60% of the cluster is however running OSA
* The remainder of the cluster is configured for server bare metal server environments as per the community requests thus far.
* Each cabinet has two top-of-rack Cisco Nexus 3172-PQ network switches.
* Each cabinet also has one top-of-rack network switch for out-of-band management.

The hardware is broken out into two cloud regions and the details are below:

****Cloud Region 1****

	Nodes running RPC-O (Rackspace Private Cloud) version 11.0:
	17 Server cabinets
	
	1x Deployment node
	3x Controller nodes
	7x Logging nodes
    132x Compute nodes with spindle drives
    44x Compute nodes with Intel SSD S3500
    66x Compute nodes with Intel SSD S3700
    44x Cinder nodes
    4x Swift Proxy nodes
    40x Swift Object Storage nodes

	Bare metal nodes (not running RPC-O):

    10x Compute nodes with spindle drives (In-use by Intel Bare Metal CI Team)

	Unused nodes:

    12x Compute nodes with spindle drives
    4x Controller nodes
    5x Network nodes (Will probably used to put Neutron agents on)
    1x Util node (Running HAProxy right now)
    1x Jump node

****Cloud Region 2****

	Nodes running RPC-O (Rackspace Private Cloud) version 11.0:
	29 Server cabinets

    1x Deployment node
    3x Controller nodes
    7x Logging nodes
    154x Compute nodes with spindle drives
    44x Compute nodes with Intel SSD S3500
    66x Compute nodes with Intel SSD S3700
    44x Cinder nodes
    4x Swift Proxy nodes
    40x Swift Object Storage nodes

	Bare metal nodes (not running RPC-O):

    242x Compute nodes with spindle drives (In-use by Mirantis)

	Unused nodes:

    22x Compute nodes with spindle drives
    4x Controller nodes
    5x Network nodes
    1x Util node (Running HAProxy right now)
    1x Jump node


**Who’s using the Developer Cloud?**

Currently the Intel Bare Metal CI Team and Mirantis are the only OSIC customers using the cluster as of today.  Both of those teams are using the bare metal server option as mentioned above.  The next consumers slated to come on board will the the OpenStack Foundation Infrastructure team and moving the OSIC sign-up form from this [link](http://go.rackspace.com/developercloud) to http://www.osic.org, which will sit on the Developer cloud as well.

We will close out this update with two pretty pictures.  Rather confident that you like myself wishes that this was a screenshot of Horizon from their home labs.  We can all dream right?  Please stay tuned for more updates to come and keep Stacking!
