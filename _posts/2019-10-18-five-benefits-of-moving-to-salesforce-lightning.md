Change can be daunting, even when you know you’re moving toward a better solution. 
As a Salesforce administrator, you probably know that it’s in your organization’s 
best interest to make the leap from Salesforce Classic to Lightning. The challenge is &mdash; how can you sell this critical step to your superiors and your team? 

Here are the top five reasons for transitioning to Salesforce Lightning.


#### Greater productivity

In mid-2018, Salesforce released a [Forrester Consulting study](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/total-economic-impact-study-on-salesforce-lightning-shows-341-percent-return-on-investment-over-three-years-300661371.html) that identified increased productivity as one of the greatest benefits of moving to the Lightning experience. The study found that the combination of a newer interface and forward-thinking tools like Salesforce Einstein, made it easier for users to accelerate existing processes. 

In fact, [the study revealed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/total-economic-impact-study-on-salesforce-lightning-shows-341-percent-return-on-investment-over-three-years-300661371.html) that IT departments that transitioned to Lightning increased measurable productivity “by up to 25 percent and [has cut] time-to-market for applications nearly in half.”

#### Saved time and dollars

The Forrester study also showcased Salesforce Lightning’s ability to trim costs and save valuable working hours. The 3-year economic impact study showed Salesforce Lightning can save “end users in sales organizations more than an hour a week in productivity.” Moreover, because there is significantly less turnover in developer roles, some organizations saved more than $165,000 in hiring costs alone.

#### Third party integrations and customizations

The Salesforce Lightning framework makes it easier than ever for developers to create modern Salesforce apps. As a result, integration with various third party apps becomes much more accessible for administrators and developers.

Lightning also makes it possible to add custom components to the interface. These customization options offer better opportunities for personalization than Salesforce Classic.

#### Modernized user interface

The updated look and feel of Salesforce Lightning makes it a user favorite. New UI features were designed with key business teams in mind, as Salesforce created an [intuitive and smart-thinking platform](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring16/release-notes/rn_lex.htm) that “helps sales reps work more naturally and close more deals faster.” 

What’s so special about the interface changes? At first glance, you’ll notice things like easier-to-read text, icons, and graphics that provide a better overall business snapshot. Updated dashboards give you improved visibility into the metrics that matter most to your role, so you can grasp the big picture for your teams and customers. 

Ultimately, the convenience and ease of a streamlined interface makes it easier to foster user adoption of your platform.

#### Certainty for the future

Simply put, Salesforce Lightning is the way of the future. There is a great deal of uncertainty about how long [interface support for Salesforce Classic](https://tech.co/crm-software/salesforce-lightning-vs-classic-compared) will be available. To avoid the risk of your organization being automatically rolled over to Lightning at an unexpected time, be proactive and make a planned switch.
