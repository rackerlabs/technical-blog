I will confess, I am old enough to remember my GeoCities page. Don't hate. It was amazing, it was... this transformative moment in which I took real, actual information, and transformed it into something visible and memorable. I once heard someone say the GeoCities was nothing but the interior locker door of the early Internet. I agree, if you remove the words “nothing but” and pronounce the sentence with a nostalgic sense of awe. That was, and still is, the heart of the web - the convenient, interactive display of data to the multitudes. I respect (even worship) the idea of the Internet as a sort of Universal Library. On that note, if you haven't donated to Wikipedia yet, go do it.  
 
But. 
 
I am no longer a child, and when I grew, I put away childish things. I still, as an internal applications developer at Rackspace, do a lot of work that boils down to intricate GeoCities pages - except instead of my favorite sparkly animated butterfly gifs, the information I now seek to communicate is much more dry, and eminently more interesting to others (but if anyone wants to trade sparkly butterfly gifs, hit me up on Twitter). Most of what I build is still simply taking information that is one place and moving it to another where it is more visible to those interested in it.<!--More-->  
 
The difference -- the MAGICAL difference -- between my old GeoCities page and the great web repositories of today is that, somehow, robots have become interested in my sparkly butterfly gifs! 
 
I came of age as a programmer in the era of Web 2.0, a word that somehow (in spite of all the meaning it’s lost over the past 10 years) continues to become more and more meaningless as time passes. When I say Web 2.0, what comes to mind? 3D logos? Bright colored pages with round-rect frames? Sure - and don't get me wrong, I lurves teh design. I think beauty is one of the revolutionary aspects of the rebirth of thought around the Internet that came with my younger sisters and brothers, born on the Internet, coming of age and demanding that their web pages feel less like DMVs and more like coffee shops. But in my mind, the truly transformative part of the last 10 years of Internet history has been in the introduction of web applications with  clean, consumable and useful API layers.  
 
Twitter is a great hero (sadly - and we'll get to this - a tragic hero) of this revolution. As a Ruby programmer, when I was learning how to build programs that felt like poetry instead of caveman-speak, the subject of my poetry (the “sonnet-form of the nascent code-poet” as it were) was either the blog or the thingie-that-talked-to-Twitter. And the thingie-that-talked-to-Twitter was eminently the more awesome of the two. One of those moments of childlike wonder-in-a-pinafore for me was the moment that I typed “ruby ./twitter_poster.rb” on my command line, pressed enter, and HOLY CRAP! A REAL HONEST TO OZMA TWEET SHOWED UP IN MY TIMELINE ON REAL TWITTER! OH MY GOD! 
 
Holy Crap moments like that are powerful, meaningful things. I was, sadly, not present at the moment when Jobs, Woz and the kids jabbed a button and got the Apple II prototype to boot up the first time - but I imagine it was the same feeling, that transformative moment of "I have just done something that is real." It is a feeling of Kwisatz Haderach, of magic, where one's incantations produce a spell with real, worldly effects. It is how programmers are born. This alone should be an argument for an open API. Part of what made Twitter so beloved, what made the technical community so patient with its fail-whales and its puckish refusal to come up with a business plan for so long in the young, heady days was that "We accept her, Gooble-gobble, one of us" feeling. If Hotmail crashed, you rolled your eyes and thought “Good gravy, don't you know how to build a website?“ But, when TWITTER fail-whaled, you thought, "oh, those poor developers - I know how THAT feels." Goodwill is made by a relationship, and developers have relationships in code (there's a t-shirt waiting to be printed in that statement, somewhere). 
 
But more than this, here's the thing: the Twitter ecosystem was FULL of awesome (again: *was*. We'll get to that). Daring Fireball once said that Twitter was this amazing place to see good thinkers show their chops. And it made Twitter instantly bearable on any platform over the last several years of transformative change. When smartphones came out, all those developers who LOVED Twitter (because, you know, gooble-gobble) fell all over themselves to pour out a bevy of Twitter clients. The best floated to the top, and were perfected to a knife edge far keener than the Twitter website (which I still fail to effectively love). When tablets came out, the same thing happened again. When people started using Twitter for businesses, people built clients well adapted for that. People built an entire CULTURE around Twitter that Twitter DID NOT DESIGN. It was made for them. People pay consultants bajillions to build cultures, and they usually fail anyway. Twitter got one FOR FREE. 
 
And... 
 
Twitter became this hub around which other services flew. When Instagram rolled out, it integrated into Twitter first. Long before that, services like URL shorteners and image sharing services integrated into Twitter - and the third-party Twitter apps integrated them so seamlessly that you almost forgot they weren't PART of Twitter. For free. Out of love and gooble-gobble friendship. Twitter ceased to be a web-page, and became a service. One of the great stones upon which teh Interwebs was built. 
 
Which is why I still wear a black armband for what Twitter did. 
 
The magic of Twitter, as a developer, was that I felt like we were friends, almost. That we trusted each other. When they shut down the API to the ridiculous level at which it now operates, I felt betrayed. I mean, I didn't built Tweetdeck or bit.ly or any other service that changed Twitter from a toy into a powerful, complex world. But I felt as if... well, as if Twitter took all of us, the external developers who gave so much to it, and cast us off.  
 
"We have what we need, now. Begone. Let us make money. Have fun with your new business plans." 
 
I felt betrayed, because the thing about an API is that, for better or worse, it doesn't feel like a business transaction. It feels like an invitation to a party, like a gift between friends. 
 
As it should. 
 
The transformative potential of the virtual world we now live in has absolutely nothing to do with business models, with captains of industry, with profit margins or with capital. It has to do with a basic realignment of what it means to be a website. A website is no longer a single GeoCities page waiting to be admired for its collection of sparkle-gifs. It is not even, like (for example) Pinterest in isolation from other tools: a vast network where everyone can swap sparkle-gifs like some sort of strange, self-reproducing virtual Yu-Gi-Oh cards. The Internet is going to become a world where I can swap a sparkle-fly, stream it into my Twitter account, have an analytics application download “Aliens” from Netflix, use my iPad to select that scene where the alien jumps out of the guy’s chest,  use a cloud video editor application to dynamically replace the alien with the sparkle-fly,  overlay the soundtrack from “Spaceballs” where it sings "Hello My Baby," then have it all upload to YouTube and update my blog with a link. And have this happen, from my perspective, not so much as a series of individually managed transactions with a series of individual applications, but as in integrated, powerful experience. Does that sound crazy? Imagine at the birth of Twitter, someone telling you that in a few years you'd be able to take a picture of your kids with your cellphone, crop it, resize it, slap a filter on it and send it in a tweet along with a 140-char-friendly shortened link to a YouTube video of the aforementioned scene from “Aliens” and some pithy comment connecting the two, then to slip your phone in your pocket and have it whistle at you the very instant your mother tweeted back to suggest you need a therapist. 
 
Or, if you want something “practical” ... 
 
Inside Rackspace, we have long used Zendesk as our ticketing solution for the wonderful folks you talk and chat with when you call up with a cloud-related issue. Zendesk, since its API redesign not too long ago, has a beautiful andglorious API (not PERFECT, mind you, but WONDERFUL). This allowed us to build an app that: 

* Downloads all our Zendesk tickets as they come in,
* Plops them into a local database, 
* Simultaneously and dynamically adds tags (which assign the tickets to their correct account managers), 
* Utilizes business logic (special rules - like if it was the first ticket we got from a specific user), 
* And communicates metrical data to our ever-so-clever analytics teams (who get to mine that data about what we could do to make our customers happier). 
 
In the great someday, imagine an app where we interacted between this sort of data and, say, our monitoring service, or OpenStack itself, to analyze and autocorrect certain issues, or even better, to group users into need groups who we could PROACTIVELY call to offer long-term solutions to their issues? APIs: they is magical. 

Which makes it so sad to me that some of the most powerful apps on the web are closing or restricting their API usage. Twitter, now Netflix too, both come to mind. Why? *shrug* There's a reason I'm not a business major. But my gut tells me that any profitability they get by not sharing their toys will, in the long term, end up costing them the things that have made them not only profitable, but beautiful - human ideas.  Goodwill, external creativity, a feeling of partnership with the world. Business, in a world of interdependence and connectivity isn't cut-throat; not on the level of developers. The football teams of Yale and Harvard may have their rivalries, but the poets and dreamers should be collaborating and co-authoring texts. The world is full of genius, and you can only hire so much of it - the rest you have to invite in. And give them cookies when they come. Or, the gooble-gobble cup.
