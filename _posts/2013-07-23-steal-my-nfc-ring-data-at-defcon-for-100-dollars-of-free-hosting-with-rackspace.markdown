Let me elaborate. In a world of security breaches and stolen data I prefer to embrace emerging technology and the security community as a whole instead of hide from it. I was recently sent a link for an [NFC Ring](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mclear/nfc-ring "NFC Ring") with some interesting features. Many, myself included, have tried to create useful NFC or RFID based wearable devices before but they were too bulky or lacked any form of security. John's idea is simple, and hopefully effective: Put your private data, on the inside. It appears to be designed in a way that the private NFC data is only accessible if your hand is open (grabbing a door knob for instance). I find this very interesting for use as another factor of auth that is fun to hack on and easy to integrate. I contacted John with an idea, and fortunately he was on board. DEFCON is next week, if there is any place to test the security and design of a product that is the place. So, the idea is this: **Steal my NFC Ring data for $100 of free hosting with Rackspace.**

That is right, if you can steal the email address and the code off the inside of the ring I will be wearing at DEFCON, you can earn yourself $100 of free hosting and be added to the list of successful physical hackers that will be maintained in this post. First claim wins that round, and I will rotate the code at least once every day. Each day or round after the code is stolen (not if, we all know it is just a matter of time) I will have the ring available so anyone that wants to see it can check it out.

I should be easy to spot, I will be wearing the shirt that says **"Steal my NFC Ring data for $100 of free hosting with Rackspace."** All I ask if that you be kind about it, I know I am making myself a target, but I am doing it in the spirit of camaraderie and collective exploration so let's keep it civil.

Good Luck.
