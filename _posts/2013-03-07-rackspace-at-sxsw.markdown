##Tech Tac Toe

The Rackspace SXSW street team and volunteers will be handing out Tech Tac Toe game boards at Champions and around the convention center. Attendees can play the game for a chance at prizes. It’s simple to win – players spot the different items from the list at the bottom of the game board and take turns filling it in. The rules of traditional Tic Tac Toe apply: the first player to reach three in a row wins and can bring the board to Champions for a prize (while supplies last).
