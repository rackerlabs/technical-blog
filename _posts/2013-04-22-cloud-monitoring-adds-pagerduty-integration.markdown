{% img right /images/2013-04-22-cloud-monitoring-pagerduty/cloud_monitoring_pagerduty.png 160 160 %}[Cloud Monitoring](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/monitoring/)
now supports [PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com)
integration! With this new notification type, alarm notifications can
automatically create new incidents and resolve them once Cloud Monitoring
detects things are okay.<!--More-->

Because the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/)
doesn't support creating notifications and notification plans,
[raxmon](https://github.com/racker/rackspace-monitoring-cli) is
one of the easier ways to set up PagerDuty notifications. If you haven't used raxmon
before, there is a great guide for setting things up
[here](http://devops.rackspace.com/using-raxmon-to-configure-rackspace-cloud-monitoring.html).

In order to do this, we just have to go through the following steps:

1. Figure out your PagerDuty service key
2. Create the new PagerDuty notification
3. Create or update a Cloud Monitoring notification plan
4. Update an alarm to use your new notification plan
5. Do a [happy dance](http://i.imgur.com/aqQK8IE.gif)

If you'd like to dive right into things, there is a [tl;dr](#tldr) at
the bottom of the page.

The first thing you'll need to do is make sure you have configured a
PagerDuty service to use with Cloud Monitoring. 

1. In your PagerDuty account, under the Services tab, click "Add New Service."
2. Enter a name for the service, select an escalation policy and choose "Generic API system" for the Service Type.
3. Click the "Add Service" button.
4. Once the service is created, you'll be taken to the service page. On this page, you'll see the "Service key," which you will use when you create your notification.

Next you'll need to create the Cloud Monitoring 
[notification](http://docs.rackspace.com/cm/api/v1.0/cm-devguide/content/service-notifications.html) that you'll
attach to a notification plan with the service key you've obtained from
PagerDuty. To do this with raxmon, do the following:

	raxmon-notifications-create --type=pagerduty \
	--details=service_key=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234

After you do this, raxmon will return a new ID for the notification that
will look something like `nt23k123`. You'll want to keep this ID handy
for the next step of creating a
[notification plan](http://docs.rackspace.com/cm/api/v1.0/cm-devguide/content/service-notification-plans.html).

To view a detailed list of your existing notification plans, you can use the following
raxmon command:

	raxmon-notification-plans-list --details

By default Cloud Monitoring has a single, dynamic notification plan
named `npTechnicalContactsEmail` that sends an email notification to each of the 
technical contacts on your Rackspace account. If this is the only
notification plan you see, you'll want to create a new one to take
advantage of the new PagerDuty integration. 

Notification plans allow you to specify what notifications you want to
use per alarm state(e.g. **OK**, **WARNING**, **CRITICAL**). This gives you the
flexibility of doing something like emailing on **WARNING** and actually
creating an incident in PagerDuty for **CRITICAL** events.
Use raxmon to do this by using the following commands:
  
	raxmon-notification-plan-create --ok-notifications=nt23k123 \
	--warning-notifications=nt23k123 --critical-notifications=nt23k123

This command will create a new notification plan and return an ID
that looks something like `npTY46f7`. Your new notification plan will
trigger an incident per alarm on **WARNING** and **CRITICAL** events and automatically
resolve the incident when an **OK** event is triggered. 

**Note**: Incidents are triggered per alarm, meaning that a new incident will
be created per alarm, as opposed to creating an incident per check or
entity. Any additional alarm state changes for an incident will be appended
to the currently active incident until it is resolved.

If you wanted to trigger incidents on **WARNING** and **CRITICAL**
events and resolve the incidents with PagerDuty while also sending an
email notification (e.g. `nt76df3U`) on **OK** events, you could run the
following command:

	raxmon-notification-plan-create --ok-notifications=nt23k123,nt76df3U \
	--warning-notifications=nt23k123 --critical-notifications=nt23k123

**Note**: Once you've created or updated your notification plan, you can use the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) to configure
alarms to use it. Read on for how to do this with raxmon.

Next you will want to identify which alarm you want to update. To do
this list your alarms for an entity with the id of `enKEb23jB` by using:

	raxmon-alarms-list --entity-id=enKEb23JB

This will show you the alarms associated with an entity and their
labels. If you would like more information about the alarms, you can use
the `--details` flag.

Your final step to take advantage of the new PagerDuty integration is
to [update your alarms](http://docs.rackspace.com/cm/api/v1.0/cm-devguide/content/service-alarms.html#service-alarms-update)
to use your newly-created notification plan. Use
the ID that your call to `raxmon-notification-plan-create` returned and
the alarm ID you've picked out, and running the following:

	raxmon-alarms-update  --entity-id=enKEb23JB --id=alwp0UoI45 \
	--notification-plan=npTY46f7

After doing this you are all set! Cloud Monitoring will now
automatically trigger and resolve incidents through PagerDuty.
