[SaltStack][1] is hosting a global event on Saturday, July 27 called the "[Great Salt Sprint][2]" - a chance to get together with other Salt users and hack on Salt code. SaltStack is a systems and configuration management for fast and scalable deployment and automation of any cloud. The Salt open source project was launched in February of 2011. SaltStack was founded in August 2012 to support the Salt project and to deliver commercialized SaltStack Enterprise software. The Great Salt Sprint will focus on the several areas. <!--More-->

* Development of [OpenStack][3] functionality from within Salt
* Increased functionality related to monitoring
* Adding to the Salt Formulae repositories
* Improved test coverage for Salt

Community members will be on hand to help drive these goals. Several locations have already been announced:

* Ann Arbor, MI
* Austin, TX
* London, United Kingdom
* Los Angeles, CA
* New York, NY
* Paris, France (Friday, July 26)
* Salt Lake City, UT
* San Antonio, TX (@ Rackspace)
* San Francisco, CA
* Seattle, WA

You can also partcipate virtually if there isn't a group near you. Rackspace is also very excited to host the San Antonio group at our [headquarters][4]. Attendence is free! More information can be found at [The Great Salt Sprint page][2] or you can sign up to participate on [Eventbrite][5].
