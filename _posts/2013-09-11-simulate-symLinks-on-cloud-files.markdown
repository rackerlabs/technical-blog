Rackspace cloud files which is based on [Openstack Swift](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/) provides reliable & fast, object storage and you can read more about the product [here](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/technology/)

In Cloud Files, there is no inbuilt way to do aliases or multiple names to the same object. However, after some documentation trolling and speaking to some of our Cloud Files engineers, there is a way to achieve it, although it is not straightforward.<!-- more -->

Cloud Files offers large file (over 5G) support by allowing multiple segments to be uploaded and then a manifest that links the segments. This is well explained is this [blog post](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-cloud-files-now-supporting-extremely-large-file-sizes/)

We can leverage the same feature to achieve symlinking/aliasing. To begin with get an auth token


	curl -D - \
  	  -H "X-Auth-Key: <replace with your api key>" \
  	  -H "X-Auth-User: <replace with your username>" \
  	  https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0


Results will be along these lines

	HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
	Server: nginx/0.8.55
	Date: Sat, 24 Aug 2013 14:12:13 GMT
	Connection: keep-alive
	X-Storage-Token: <storage token>
	X-Storage-Url: <returned storage URL>
	X-Server-Management-Url: <returned server management URL>
	X-CDN-Management-Url: <returned CDN management URL>
	X-Auth-Token: <auth token used for subsequent requests>
	vary: Accept, Accept-Encoding, X-Auth-Token, X-Auth-Key, X-Storage-User, X-Storage-Pass, X-Auth-User
	Cache-Control: s-maxage=85963
	VIA: 1.0 Repose (Repose/2.3.5)
	Front-End-Https: on

Now let's create a test file which we will use for the symlink.

	echo 'Analys(z)e  This !! :)' >adata.txt

We now upload this file to a Cloud Files container named 'examples' using the storage URL returned above.

	curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <auth token from above>' \
	<storage URL from above>/examples/adata.txt --data-binary '@adata.txt'

Now we use our friendly X-Object-Manifest header to create the links we want. Create a link for analyse.txt. In this case we pass an empty input to --data-binary

	curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <auth token from above>' \
	-H 'X-Object-Manifest: examples/adata.txt' \
	<storage URL from above>/examples/analyse.txt --data-binary ''

Then create a link for analyze.txt

	curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <auth token from above>' \
	-H 'X-Object-Manifest: examples/adata.txt' \
	-H 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8' \
	<storage URL from above>/examples/analyze.txt --data-binary ''


Test with curl 

	curl http://54f0e726bcfd86d8ba66-784e69335b6098f55ce69a880b15667d.r49.cf3.rackcdn.com/analyse.txt
	Analys(z)e  This !! :)

	curl http://54f0e726bcfd86d8ba66-784e69335b6098f55ce69a880b15667d.r49.cf3.rackcdn.com/analyze.txt
	Analys(z)e  This !! :)

We have effectively created a symlink to another object inside the cloud files container.

If you are using CDN, you likely have more friendly URLS and they will work the same

	curl <Friendly CDN URL>/analyse.txt
	curl <Friendly CDN URL>/analyze.txt

While this may seem like bit of a workaround, functionality wise, this will work the same as any other object storage operation in Cloud Files.
