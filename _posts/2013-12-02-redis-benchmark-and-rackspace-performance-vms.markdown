While I was visiting the [Concurix team](http://www.concurix.com) getting a demo of
some of the awesomeness they have for node.js profiling,
[Bryce Baril](https://github.com/brycebaril) mentioned that he was a new
[node-redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) core-committer and how
performance was really critical for the redis package (and redis in general).

I asked what he used to benchmark and he informed me that redis has a very
robust benchmarking tool built in.

```
> redis-benchmark
```

I immediatley thought of using `redis-benchmark` to illustrate the difference
between our (soon to be deprecated) standard flavors and our new performance
flavors. Based on some reading on the redis-benchmark page, I decided to use
the same critiera as the Redis Benchmarks page for
[evaluating bare-metal and virtual machines](http://redis.io/topics/benchmarks).

<!-- more -->

```
> redis-benchmark -r 1000000 -n 2000000 -t get,set,lpush,lpop -q -P 16
> redis-benchmark -r 1000000 -n 2000000 -t get,set,lpush,lpop -q
```

In both cases, I used 1gb virtual machines, running
`Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) (PVHVM beta)` in the ORD datacenter. Redis is
version `2.6.7` and I ran the test 5 times on each machine.

I'm not claiming to be an expert on Redis performance, but it's obvious that
**our new performance flavors kick ass**. We're seeing 35-45% faster results
in the non-pipelined case, and 16-31% in the pipelined case. Not bad
considering we made the pricing even more competitive.

If you haven't already signed up for our [Developer Trial](https://developer.rackspace.com/devtrial)
you should to give the new servers a spin, hopefully these numbers will help entice you!
