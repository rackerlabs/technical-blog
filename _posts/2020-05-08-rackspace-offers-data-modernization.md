As data volume, variety, and sources quickly increase, businesses can struggle to manage
their data and generate meaningful analysis. Companies risk falling behind competitors who
are able to effectively manage this information. Not all organizations have developed the
required technical skills and business processes to implement modern data analytics solutions.
This is where Rackspace can help.

<!-- more -->

The architects and data engineers at Rackspace accelerate the value you get from your data by using
leading cloud data analytics frameworks. Rackspace offers deep technical and business process expertise
to help you gain actionable intelligence from your data by providing the following data modernization services:

- Assessment and strategy
- Data transformation


### Data analytics assessment and strategy

Rackspace helps you develop a practical solution that focuses on both technology and business transformation.

This solution includes:

**Data Discovery Workshop:** Data architects conduct an on-site workshop to discuss best practices,
introduce core analytics and big data concepts, ideate solutions for high-priority use cases, and
determine if a proof-of-concept or MVP is needed.

**Modern Data Architecture Assessment & Strategy:** Rackspace data architects conduct on-site sessions
to assess the current state of the data analytics services, organization culture and process around data,
determine business use cases, priorities and build out a complete data strategy and an implementation roadmap.


### Data transformation

From designing the architecture to delivering dashboards with real-time refreshes, Rackspace helps you
transform how data is collected, processed, and delivered to your stakeholders. This might start with
a proof-of-concept on your data sample to demonstrate the value of data-driven decisions to your business.
If you are further in your journey, we can develop a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) to see how
to leverage data analytics in practice. Or you may be ready for a full production solution which includes:

- **Data Platform Architecture and Design:** Rackspace designs and builds an enterprise grade production
environment leveraging automation, ingestion best practices, data processing, storage patterns and cloud best practices.
- **Data Integration:** Rackspace develops data pipelines to ingest, transform, and store data.
- **Data Modeling:** Rackspace data engineers define data models and create schemas, data translations, and consumption pattern best practices.
- **BI & Reporting:** Rackspace data engineers will build dashboards and real-time data refreshes as well as build and automate operational and business reporting, so you have complete and readily available insight into your data.


### Benefits

**Become a data-driven organization:** Spend less time managing and tracking data and more time deriving actionable intelligence to make valuable business decisions. Companies that lack data discipline and insights are losing out on innovation.

**Reduce time and costs:** Accelerate development time from months to weeks, drive down delivery costs and generate significant ROI thru revenue generation, implementation savings and operating efficiencies.

**Break down data silos:** Streamline your data architecture to enable easy access across your organization and encourage transparent, accurate and faster collaboration.

**Self-service:** Enable self-service access to data across the organization to foster collaboration and data exploration to create new use cases not possible with the current data architecture.


### Conclusion

Rackspace has a cloud-agnostic team that can assess your current systems, identify your business
objectives, and design your ideal future state reference data architecture. Rackspace uses its
data analytics and tooling expertise to generate a roadmap that accounts for future data management,
analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning workloads. Work with experts today to get the most out of your data.
