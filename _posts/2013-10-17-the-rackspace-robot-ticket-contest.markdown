We at Rackspace are proud to support innovative uses of open source and cloud
technologies  and one of the most exciting and interesting uses these days
is in the fusion  of the hardware and software worlds. The upcoming
[RobotsConf](http://robotsconf.com) event (December 6<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup>
in Amelia Island, FL) is an incredibly focused event on this specific use and we
are happy to be supporting it. Luckily we have an extra ticket and we want one
of you to attend the event to help build the next generation of robots!

We are holding a contest between now and October 31<sup>st</sup> at 11:59 PM
Pacific Standard Time. In a tweet with the hashtag #rackerbot, describe the
robot or robotic system you want to build. If your idea exceeds the available
130 characters, you can either write it up in a seperate file and link to it
OR join tweets together with an ellipsis (...). Finally make sure you are
following the [RobotsConf](http://twitter.com/robotsconf) twitter account and
we will contact the winner via a direct message on November 4<sup>th</sup> with
details about how to register for the ticket.

We look forward to seeing all of your great robot ideas and the blend of cloud
and robotics yet to come!
