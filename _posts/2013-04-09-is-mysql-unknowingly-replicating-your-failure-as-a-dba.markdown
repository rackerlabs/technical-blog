MySQL replication offers an opportunity to distribute your database to multiple nodes for additional performance or to off-load specific functionality from your production stack. When uptime is a requirement, table-locking can create unavailability and a long-running nightly backup can cause an unexpected outage. One benefit of replication is that it allows the backup to happen on the slave without interrupting your production environment. So what happens  when you rely on this configuration to safeguard your data without constantly ensuring that the replication process is working? I'll tell you what happens – you're the guy without a recent backup.<!-- more -->  

Rackspace Managed Cloud customers rely on us to provide insight into their configuration. It is important that we have an accurate assessment of slave status and the ability to provide notifications if there are errors. With the Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Agent, we can provide notification to the customer if the slave is in error status or if the slave lags behind the master.

Using a plugin with the Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Agent is simple. Before proceeding, you must [install the agent](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/install-the-cloud-monitoring-agent). For our scenario, we wrote a Python script that will check the slave status and provide metrics back to the Cloud Monitoring environment. With the plugin working on the Cloud Server, add a new check and an alarm with the desired criteria. Here is a curl command to create the check:

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
-H 'X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
--data-binary \
'{"label": "<CHECK_TITLE>", "type": "agent.plugin", "details": {"file": "<FILENAME>"}}' \
'https://monitoring.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/<ACCOUNT_ID>/entities/<ENTITY_ID>/checks'
```

The above portions that need values corresponding to your environment should be obvious. The elements that are specific to your plugin are the check_title and the filename. In this example, the script is named mysql_replication.py and it is located in the /usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins/ directory.  If the directory does not exist, create it. You can also confirm that the plugin is running by checking the log. The log should be located at /var/log/rackspace-monitoring-agent.log.  You should expect to see entries similar to the following:

`(plugin=mysql_replication.py) -> check completed (id=chdVhpS6Ya, type=agent.plugin, state=available)
(plugin=mysql_replication.py) -> agent.plugin (id=chdVhpS6Ya, period=150s) scheduled for 150s`

Once you run the command above, creating the check, you will need to create a coinciding alarm. Within the new [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com), you can add your alarm criteria and choose your notification options, or you can use [raxmon](https://github.com/racker/rackspace-monitoring-cli) or curl.

Below, is an alarm criteria that can be modified based on your requirements:

```python
if (metric['SLAVE_STATUS'] != 'ONLINE') {
    return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, 'MySQL Replication is OFFLINE.');
}

if (metric['SLAVE_STATUS'] == 'ONLINE' && metric['SECONDS_BEHIND_MASTER'] >= 300) {
    return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, 'MySQL Replication ONLINE - slave behind master.');
}
```

The above criteria will change the AlarmStatus if replication is offline or if the slave lags too far behind the master. If something goes wrong, you can expect a friendly email from our Cloud Monitoring product. Hopefully, you can avoid that awkward moment where you explain to your boss that your backup is six months old because you didn't bother to check your slave status.
