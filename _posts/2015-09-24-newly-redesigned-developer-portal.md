You may have noticed our Developer Portal looks different. This portal provides you with everything you need to build powerful, scalable apps using our Software Developer Kits (SDKs), which are built on open-source platforms and take advantage of our extensive APIs. We have redesigned Developer.Rackspace.com.

<!-- more -->

The new design creates a consistent experience for you to interact with our updated developer guides and API reference content (just check out our new [Rackspace Cloud Guide to Core Infrastructure Services](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/)).

This is the first step in rolling out an enhanced customer experience across all of our Product and Support documentation. The newly designed Developer Portal was crafted with the customer in mind. We’ve worked with our User Research team and taken feedback from you in order to align directly with your expectations in the updated design. So, take a look around and let us know what you think by [providing feedback to us here](https://feedback.rackspace.com/forums/319947-developer-rackspace-com).  

Happy Developing!
