Rackspace will be present at [Cloud Connect](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/chicago/) in Chicago this week! If you're a Rackspace customer we would love for you to stop by our booth and talk to us about how your company uses the [Open Cloud](http://rackspace.com/cloud). We also have several Rackers speaking during the conference:

##### Tuesday September 11th


**10AM, Keynote:**
John Engates: _Our Cloud is Your Cloud - Embracing Open Cloud Infrastructure Standards_
**Description**: There are inherent obstacles when you embark on a two-year journey to build one of the largest open source public cloud infrastructures. These include challenges that range from building a community of developers and partners around a brand new open source project to the the massive operational aspects of adopting a new cloud platform. Even after crossing a milestone that was a long time in the making, it's still only the beginning of the journey to widespread open cloud adoption; but to continue building the bridge out of your data center, it's important to understand all the nuts and bolts of the transition. Come hear Rackspace CTO, John Engates, outline his experiences and share insights on how to have a turbulence-free climb to the open cloud.

**1:15PM, Grand Ballroom A:**
Wayne Walls: _Comparing Cloud Orchestration Stacks_
**Description**: Cloud orchestration stacks are an important component in completing the move to a private cloud. In this rapid fire session, speakers representing key cloud orchestration stacks will have 10 minutes each to present their responses to key questions about the functions, features and capabilities of each cloud stack. Questions include: services and capabilities offered; languages, operating systems, APIs and image formats supported; virtualization stacks supported; management tools; portability; hardware, capacity, performance and availability constraints, pricing and more. Presentations will be followed by an open Q and A discussion.

**2:30PM, Grand Ballroom C:**
Wayne Walls: _Agile-techture: Nimble Cloud Engineering_
**Description**: Building a large-scale OpenStack public cloud is no easy task.  Even harder, how to do you keep it up to date with a rapidly growing community with hundreds of lines of code added daily? Come hear Rackspace Developer Advocate Wayne Walls discuss the importance of staying agile while maintaining a public cloud comprising of thousands of users.  He will discuss open API integration into the business, continuous integration, and other practices that will allow your organization to roll to production faster.


##### Wednesday, September 12th


**1:50PM, Cloud Solutions Theater:**
Hart Hoover: _Architecting WordPress on the Rackspace Cloud_
**Description**: If you'd like to be able to use an IaaS offering to scale your WordPress configuration, come see a quick dive into the world of hosting in the cloud. We'll walk you through load balancing, planning capacity, managing DNS and your domains as well as best practices for hosting WordPress on the Open Cloud.


##### Thursday, September 13th:


**11:30AM, Grand Ballroom C:**
Toby Owen: _To, Through, and Beyond Cloud_
**Description**: There's lots of discussion on the compute and storage aspects of clouds, but relatively little on the details of how it's all connected. Much more sophistication is needed in the networking technology used within clouds, between clouds, and in connecting clouds to users and enterprises. Traditional networking approaches have lacked automation and integration capabilities necessary to match the scale and speed that cloudy environments demand. This panel will explore three cloud scenarios and discuss the networking implications of each. We'll look at a cloudy data center, a hybrid cloud deployment, and a distributed cloud. The panelists will discuss what works and what doesn't in cloud and virtualization platforms, networking gear, and network service offerings for each scenario. How can networks be integrated in provisioning? Will moving the database to collocation really improve performance? What are the best connections for a resilient design? We'll tackle all of these and more.
