bio: "I like to consider myself a hybrid technologist with over 20 years of
combined experience in leadership roles, engineering deployment roles, pre-sales
solutions architect roles, and quota-carrying B2B sales consulting roles. I am
happiest when I'm working directly with clients to transform their organizations
using AWS as the catalyst for change. My passion lies in driving cloud-based
project design through business-drivers analysis, resulting in well-architected
AWS information technology solutions. I pride myself on being capable of having
extremely granular technical conversations with an organization's top engineers,
while still being able to relate the information to non-technical C-suite executive
team members. My diverse work experience allows me to view client transformation
engagements through multiple different lenses. I've been the person to sell the
solutions, I've been the person to design the solutions, and once upon a time,
I was even the person to deliver the solutions. Like all solutions architects
worth their weight in salt, my focus is on extracting the foundational business
requirements at the core of all cloud migration initiatives and translating those
needs into an architectural design, leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure."
