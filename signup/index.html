      <p class="lead">developer+ is a powerful, extensible, 12-month infrastructure credit tier of cloud services that
        Rackspace makes available to the serious technologist who wants to go for a test drive. Unlike other offers out
        there, developer+ gives you the core of what you need to build a full, feature-rich application, plus it puts
        you in direct contact with Rackspace's developers to help you get your idea off the ground. It's the developer
        offering you'd expect from Fanatical Support&reg;.</p>

      <h2>Ready for Development</h2>

      <p>
        developer+ allows you to choose the services you need to get building today. We made sure that everything our
        own developers would want in an offer made it into developer+. It's powerful, simple and - best of all - useful.
        You pay raw infrastructure prices, and you get <strong>complete</strong> access to offerings like <a
        href="http://www.objectrocket.com/" target="_new">ObjectRocket</a>, <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/"
                                                                               target="_new">MailGun</a> and the
        upcoming <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/onmetal/" target="_new">OnMetal offering</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Extensible from Day 1</h2>

      <p>
        In addition to the credit, you'll get access to the same great no-cost features we offer to all our customers.
        Things like Cloud Monitoring, Orchestration, Cloud DNS and Cloud Networks are all included with developer+, just
        like they would be for any Rackspace customer. Let us know if you need help setting any of them up.
      </p>

      <h2>Fanatical Support&reg; for Devs</h2>

      <p>
        It wouldn't be Rackspace if we didn't have your back. The support we offer to developers often needs to be
        deeper than what other customers ask for. Because of that, we want to give you the time you need to get your
        questions answered. That's why we put you directly in touch with smart, development-focused technologists just
        like you. Rackers are ready to help you make your plans a reality.
      </p>

      <h2>Pay as you consume, at competitive prices.</h2>

      <p>
        Just as you'd expect, you can consume all Rackspace Cloud services at market-competitive, infrastructure-only
        pricing for any usage beyond the infrastructure credit we provide.
      </p>

      <h2>Stay in touch!</h2>

      <p>developer+ is all about radical transparency, and that's a two-way street. We want to give you a product you'd
        actually want to use, and we want you to give us feedback about how you're using it.</p>

      <p>A big part of this offer isn't just about letting people test-drive our products or helping incubate great
        ideas, it's also about getting feedback on how Rackspace can get better at serving developers. See, we actually
        think that our best innovations come from listening to our customers. So we'll ask you to provide us with
        honest, candid feedback about what's awesome and what's not. We're serious about taking you seriously.</p>

      <h2>The Details</h2>

      <p>The Infrastructure Credit we provide can cover many different configurations for you to build from -
      <ul>
        <li>A Performance Cloud server (1GB RAM, 1 CPU, Dedicated Raid 10 SSDs)</li>
        <li>A Cloud Load Balancer</li>
        <li>Cloud Backup - disaster recovery on tap!</li>
        <li>Cloud Block Storage (SSD or SATA)</li>
        <li>Many gigabytes of Cloud Files</li>
      </ul>

      ... or ...

      <ul>
        <li>2 Performance Cloud servers (1GB RAM, 1 CPU, Dedicated Raid 10 SSDs)</li>
        <li>A Cloud Load Balancer</li>
        <li>Cloud Block Storage (SSD or SATA)</li>
        <li>Many gigabytes of Cloud Files</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>The sky is the limit: we give you the core; the foundation for 12 months - you choose the best fit set of
        services to plug in and add to build your application!</p>

      <p>If you need help or run into some issue, you get two support calls a month. Oh, and those go directly to a
        seasoned software developer at Rackspace just like you - someone who speaks your language and understands your
        issue. Most of all, the support channels you know and love - IRC, email, whitepapers and forums will always be
        available to you, with Rackspace Developers focused on helping you.</p>

      <p>We give you a Infrastructure Credit each month that you can apply to whatever services you want. Want two 1GB
        CPUs or one 2GB? Your call. You want to hack together your own Load Balancer? Then don't pay us for one. We'll
        keep that arrangement with you for 12 months, at which point we'll welcome you fully to Rackspace Managed
        Cloud.</p>
